What they're saying about this list:
  "A cornucopia of descriptions of interrupt and function calls on the
   IBM PC.  A great thing to have on your hard disk if you don't have
   a Ray Duncan or Peter Norton book handy."
      _Turbo_Technix_, July/August 1988, p. 157.
[and that was about the 1/30/88 version, which was a mere 150K....]

  "An enormous listing of DOS and BIOS interrupt calls, many undocumented
   and program-specific.  Quite simply, some of Snooper's reports wouldn't
   be there without it.	 Very useful in that it reports bugs and
   incompatibilities books rarely mention.  And it's free!"
	John P. Vias, SNOOPER.DOC v1.07 (Snooper is a shareware system
	information program).

  "Ralf Brown maintains an astounding file which is chock-full of
   detailed, absolutely-indispensable information for DOS programmers on
   Hardware, BIOS, DOS, and other interrupts.  ....  You should not be
   without this file, which is widely-known as "Ralf Brown's Interrupt
   List". Ask about it. You will find it."
	Robert Curtis Davis, TBONES07.DOC.

  "It's the finest mess 'o Purina Geek Chow that I've seen in a coon's age."
