INT 1A - PCMCIA Socket Services v1.00 - REGISTER CARD TECHNOLOGY CALLBACK
	AH = 82h
	DS:DX -> callback routine (see #00661) or 0000h:0000h
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AH destroyed
	CF set on error
	    AH = error code (see #00656)
Note:	the callback is invoked on a Write Multiple request with an unsupported
	  card technology type
SeeAlso: AH=81h"PCMCIA",AH=94h

(Table 00661)
Values PCMCIA callback routine is invoked with:
	ES:AX -> Low-Level Socket Services Routines (see #00663)
	BH = socket attributes (see #00662)
	CX = number of bytes or words to write
	DS:SI -> data buffer to be written
	DX:DI -> 26-bit linear card address
	BP = card technology type
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AH = error code (07h,0Ch,12h,14h) (see #00656)

Bitfields for PCMCIA socket attributes:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 00662)
 7-4	reserved (0)
 3	packed buffer
 2	even bytes only (only valid if 1 set)
 1	data width (clear = byte, set = word)
 0	memory type (clear = common, set = attribute)

Format of PCMCIA Low-Level Socket Services Routines:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 00663)
 00h	WORD	offset of Write Many routine (see #00664)
 02h	WORD	offset of Write One routine (see #00665)
 04h	WORD	offset of Read One routine (see #00666)
 06h	WORD	offset of Increment Offset routine (see #00667)
 08h	WORD	offset of Set Offset routine (see #00668)
 0Ah	WORD	offset of Get Status routine (see #00669)

(Table 00664)
Call Write Many routine with:
	BH = socket attributes (see #00662)
	CX = number of bytes or words to write
	DS:SI -> data to be written
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error

(Table 00665)
Call Write One routine with:
	AL/AX = data to be written
	BH = socket attributes (see #00662)
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error

(Table 00666)
Call Read One routine with:
	BH = socket attributes (see #00662)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AL/AX = data read
	CF set on error

(Table 00667)
Call Increment Offset routine with:
	BH = socket attributes (see #00662)
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error

(Table 00668)
Call Set Offset routine with:
	DX:DI = new offset address
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error

(Table 00669)
Call Get Status routine with:
	nothing
Return: AL = current card status (see #00660)
