INT 1A - PCI BIOS v2.0c+ - READ CONFIGURATION DWORD (Brooktree devices)
	AX = B10Ah subfn 1066h
	BH = bus number
	BL = device/function number (bits 7-3 device, bits 2-0 function)
	DI = register number (0000h-00FFh) (see #00878)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    ECX = dword read
	CF set on error
	AH = status (00h,87h) (see #00729)
	EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX may be modified
	all other flags (except IF) may be modified
Notes:	this function may require up to 1024 byte of stack; it will not enable
	  interrupts if they were disabled before making the call
	the meanings of BL and BH on entry were exchanged between the initial
	  drafts of the specification and final implementation

Format of Brooktree Bt8230 ATM controller configuration:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 00981)
 00h 64 BYTEs	header (see #00878)
		(vendor ID 109Eh, device ID 8230h)
 10h	DWORD	address at which to map external memory (multiple of 16M)
		internal registers are mapped at offsets 0000h-01FFh; Bt8222
		  registers are mapped at 0200h-03FFh, and T1/E1 Framer
		  registers are mapped at 0800h-0FFFh.	Only 32-bit memory
		  accesses are used
 40h	BYTE	maximum burst length (00h not allowed, default = 10h)
 41h	BYTE	"SPECIAL_STATUS"
		bit 3: attempted to perform DMA on PCI while bus-mastering
			  disabled in PCI command word
		bit 2: PCI/DMA synchronization error occurred
		bit 1: PCI bus master encountered fatal error
		bit 0: direction of transaction which encountered error
			=0 write (refer to offset 48h)
			=1 read (refer to offset 44h)
		Note:	bits 3-1 are write-clear, bit 0 is read-only
 42h  2 BYTEs	unused
 44h	DWORD	current read target address for PCI bus master (read-only)
 48h	DWORD	current write target address for PCI bus master (read-only)
 4Ch 180 BYTEs	reserved
