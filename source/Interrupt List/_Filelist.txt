Concatenate INTERRUP.A, .B, ...  with COMBINE.COM to create an interrupt
list file identical to my master copy.

Use INTPRINT to generate a one-line-per-call summary file and/or a file
containing only data structure formats.	 See INTPRINT.DOC for details.

Note: in addition to the archives mentioned above, you may also find other
archives named INTERrrx containing additional files generated from the
original distribution for your convenience.  These other archives are
maintained by other people, so please do not ask me any questions about them
(all I'll do is refer you to the creator).  The additional distributions
I am currently aware of contain a ready-made Quick Help database (compiled
by Brad Willcott <b-willcott@adfa.oz.au>), a ready-made Norton Guides
database (compiled by Michael Gallias <gallias@iaccess.za> and distributed
as RBNGrr.*), and a ready-made WinHelp database (compiled by Ron Loewy
<76350.333@compuserve.com> and occasionally distributed as INTWIN*.*).
