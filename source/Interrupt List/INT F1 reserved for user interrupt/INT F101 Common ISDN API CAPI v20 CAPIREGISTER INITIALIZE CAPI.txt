INT F1 - Common ISDN API (CAPI) v2.0 - "CAPI_REGISTER" - INITIALIZE CAPI
	AL = 01h
	AH = CAPI version number * 10 (14h for v2.0)
	ES:BX -> buffer for CAPI's use (refer to note below)
	CX = number of bytes for message buffer
	DX = maximum simultaneous logical (Level 3) connections
	SI = maximum concurrent received B3 data blocks (min. 2)
	DI = maximum B3 data block size (up to 2048 bytes)
Return: AX = CAPI-assigned application ID
	    0000h on error
		BX = error number
		    1001h registration error
Range:	INT 00 to INT FF, selectable by program parameter
Notes:	the caller is required to provide at least 512 bytes of stack space
	the CAPI interrupt handler begins with a header (see #04068) which is
	  nearly identical to the IBM Interrupt Sharing Protocol header
	  (see #02568 at INT 2D"AMIS"), except that the short jump instruction
	  to a hardware reset handler at offset 09h is zeroed out and the
	  entire header is inexplicably shortened by one byte
	the standard document suggests using 1024 + (1024*DX) bytes for the
	  message buffer for typical applications
	the total size of the application-provided buffer must be at least
	  CX + DX*SI*DI bytes

Format of CAPI v2.0 interrupt handler entry point:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 04068)
 00h  2 BYTEs	short jump to actual start of interrupt handler, immediately
		  following this data block (EBh 0Fh)
 02h	DWORD	address of next handler in chain
 06h	WORD	signature 424Bh
 08h	BYTE	EOI flag (80h)
		80h primary hardware interrupt handler (will issue EOI)
 09h  2 BYTEs	reserved (0)
		(is short jump to hardware reset routine in ISP header)
 0Bh  4 BYTEs	signature "CAPI"
 0Fh  2 BYTEs	two-digit CAPI version number in ASCII ('20')
