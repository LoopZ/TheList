INT E0 - REAL/32 - "N_LOGON" - LOG ONTO A SERVER
	CL = 40h
	DS:DX -> LPB (see #04025)
Return: AX = status (0000h,00FFh,07FFh,0DFFh,0EFFh,FFFFh) (see #04030)
	may destroy SI,DI,DS???
SeeAlso: INT E0/CL=41h

Format of REAL/32 Logon/Logoff Parameter Block:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 04025)
 00h	BYTE	node ID
 01h  8 BYTEs	password for server access
 09h	DWORD	-> process descriptor of process to be logged on (see #04026)

Format of REAL/32 Process Descriptor:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 04026)
 00h	WORD	offset of next entry in current descriptor list
 02h	WORD	offset of thread list
 04h	BYTE	current processor status (see #04027)
 05h	BYTE	priority
 06h	WORD	runtime flags (see #04028)
 08h  8 BYTEs	process name
 10h	WORD	segment of User Data Area (UDA) (256 or 352 bytes)
 12h	BYTE	current default disk drive
 13h	BYTE	drive from which process was loaded
 14h	WORD	reserved (0)
 16h	WORD	offset of memory descriptor list for memory owned by process
 18h  6 BYTEs	reserved
 1Eh	WORD	offset of process descriptor for parent process
		0000h if parent has already terminated
 20h	BYTE	number of default console
 21h	BYTE	number of default AUX device
 22h  2 BYTEs	reserved
 24h	BYTE	number of default list device
 25h	BYTE	reserved
 26h	WORD	flags (see #04029)
 28h 12 BYTEs	reserved
 34h	WORD	offset of memory page allocation root
 36h 22 BYTEs	reserved
Note:	At least offset 10h (UDA) is also supported by MDOS 5.00, 5.01, 5.10,
	  as the DR DOS MEM utility retrieves this UDA segment through
	  INT E0/CL=9Ah when INT 21/AX=4451h returns 1463h, 1465h, or 1466h.
