INT 41 - SYSTEM DATA - HARD DISK 0 PARAMETER TABLE ADDRESS [NOT A VECTOR!]
Notes:	the default parameter table array is located at F000h:E401h in 100%
	  compatible BIOSes; the pointer may be overridden by the hard disk
	  controller's BIOS to support drive formats unknown to the ROM BIOS
	not used by some PS/2 models
	BIOSes which support four hard drives may store the parameter tables
	  for drives 81h-83h immediately following the parameter table pointed
	  at by INT 41, with a separate copy of the drive 81h table for INT 46.
	  The check for such an arrangement is to test whether INT 46 points
	  somewhere other than exactly 16 bytes past INT 41, and the sixteen
	  bytes starting at offset 10h from INT 41 are identical to the sixteen
	  bytes pointed at by INT 46
	another arrangement for BIOSes which support four IDE drives is to have
	  four tables pointed at by INT 41 in the order primary master,
	  primary slave, secondary master, and secondary slave, in which case
	  (for example) a system with only primary master and secondary master
	  will have valid tables at offsets 00h and 20h, with garbage (but
	  sectors-per-track = 00h) at offsets 10h and 30h
