INT 13 - Ontrack Drive Rocket - SET CYLINDER OFFSET
	AH = EFh
	CX = cylinder offset for next INT 13 call
	DL = drive number (80h, 81h)
Return: CF clear
	    AH = 00h
Program: Drive Rocket is a drive accelerator by Ontrack Computer Systems for
	  IDE drives supporting the read multiple and write multiple commands
Desc:	the following INT 13 call will add the number given by this call to
	  the specified cylinder to get the actual cylinder number, then reset
	  the offset to zero
Note:	this function is also supported by the NOW! disk cache, and presumably
	  newer versions of SWBIOS and Disk Manager
	for software which supports this call, AH=EEh is equivalent to calling
	  this function with CX=0400h
	the cylinder offset is reset to 0 by all INT 13 called except AH=EEh
	  and AH=EFh
