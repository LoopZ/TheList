INT 13 - FIXED DISK - FORMAT TRACK
	AH = 05h
	AL = interleave value (XT-type controllers only)
	ES:BX -> 512-byte format buffer
		the first 2*(sectors/track) bytes contain F,N for each sector
		   F = sector type
			00h for good sector
			20h to unassign from alternate location
			40h to assign to alternate location
			80h for bad sector
		   N = sector number
	CH = cylinder number (bits 8,9 in high bits of CL)
	CL = high bits of cylinder number (bits 7,6)
	DH = head
	DL = drive
Return: CF set on error
	CF clear if successful
	AH = status code (see #00234)
Notes:	AWARD AT BIOS and AMI 386sx BIOS have been extended to handle more
	  than 1024 cylinders by placing bits 10 and 11 of the cylinder number
	  into bits 6 and 7 of DH
	for XT-type controllers on an AT or higher, AH=0Fh should be called
	  first
	the IBM AT BIOS and many other BIOSes use only the low four bits of
	  DH (head number) since the WD-1003 controller which is the standard
	  AT controller (and the controller that IDE emulates) only supports
	  16 heads
	not all controller support sector types 20h and 40h
	under Windows95, an application must issue a physical volume lock on
	  the drive via INT 21/AX=440Dh before it can successfully write to
	  the disk with this function
