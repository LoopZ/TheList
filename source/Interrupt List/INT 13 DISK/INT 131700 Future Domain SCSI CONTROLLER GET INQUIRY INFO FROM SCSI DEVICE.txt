INT 13 - Future Domain SCSI CONTROLLER - GET INQUIRY INFO FROM SCSI DEVICE
	AX = 1700h
	CL = length of buffer
	DL = hard drive ID
	ES:BX -> buffer for info (see #00243)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    CH = number of bytes returned in buffer???
	CF set on error
	    AH = status code (see #00234 at AH=01h)
Notes:	this function is not available with 8-bit controller ROM versions < 7.0
	information block bytes 5-n are vendor-specific in older SCSI devices
	the TMC-950 does not support any Future Domain BIOS calls; instead,
	  it provides a full CAM implementation (see INT 4F/AX=8100h)
