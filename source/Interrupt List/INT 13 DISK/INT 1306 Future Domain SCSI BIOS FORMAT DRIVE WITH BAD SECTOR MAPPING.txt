INT 13 - Future Domain SCSI BIOS - FORMAT DRIVE WITH BAD SECTOR MAPPING
	AH = 06h
	AL = interleave
	     (0 = default, 1 = consecutive sectors, 2 - 255 = vendor unique)
	DL = hard drive ID
	DH = defect list info (see #00237)
	ES:BX -> defect table A, B or C (see #00238,#00239,#00240)
Return: CF set on error
	CF clear if successful
	AH = status code (see #00234)
Notes:	block addresses must be in ascending order (for table B, cylinder is
	  most significant, byte from index least significant; for table C,
	  cylinder is most significant, sector number least significant)
	table B defect bytes from index of FFFFFFFFh indicates that the entire
	  track shall be reassigned
	table C defect sector number of FFFFFFFFh indicates that the entire
	  track shall be reassigned
	the TMC-950 does not support any Future Domain BIOS calls; instead,
	  it provides a full CAM implementation (see INT 4F/AX=8100h)
