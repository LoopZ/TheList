INT 2C P - Cloaking - SET PORT-TRAPPING PASSALONG
	AX = 002Dh
	DX:EBX = new I/O trapping passalong address (see #02566)
Return: CF clear
Notes:	RM386 calls the passalong address whenever an access to a monitored
	  I/O port is attempted; the handler should check whether it is a port
	  that it is interested in, and if not call the previous passalong
	  address (which was retrieved with AX=002Ch before installing the
	  new handler)
	this function was first introduced with RM386 (RAM-MAN/386) v6.00
SeeAlso: AX=0009h,AX=002Ch,INT 67/AX=5DEAh

(Table 02566)
Values Cloaking port-trapping passalong address is called with:
	EAX = CS:IP of faulting instruction (unless executing in protected-mode
		ring 3)
	SS:EBX -> caller register structure (see #02559)
		check EFLAGS V86-mode bit for type
	CX = first two bytes of I/O instruction which was trapped
	DX = port to which I/O is being performed
	CF clear
Return: CF clear if RM386 should perform I/O operation
	CF set if I/O should be skipped
Note:	RM386 skips the trapped I/O instruction, so the passalong handler
	  should not modify the client CS:EIP
