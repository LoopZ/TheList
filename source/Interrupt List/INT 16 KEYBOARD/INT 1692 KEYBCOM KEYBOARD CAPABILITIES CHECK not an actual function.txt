INT 16 - KEYB.COM KEYBOARD CAPABILITIES CHECK (not an actual function!)
	AH = 92h
Return: AH <= 80h if enhanced keyboard functions (AH=10h-12h) supported
Desc:	this function is called by the DOS 3.2 KEYBxx.COM and DOS 5+ KEYB.COM
	  to determine the highest supported keyboard function
Note:	many BIOSes (including at least some versions of Phoenix and AMI) will
	  destroy AH on return from functions higher than AH=12h, returning
	  12h less than was in AH on entry (due to a chain of DEC/JZ
	  instructions)
