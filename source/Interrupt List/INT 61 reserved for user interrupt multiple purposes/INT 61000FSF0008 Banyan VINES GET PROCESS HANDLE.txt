INT 61 - Banyan VINES - GET PROCESS HANDLE
	AX = 000Fh subfn 0008h
	CX:BX -> request block (see #03450)
	DX = application's data segment (should be = CX)
	ES = DS
Return: AX = status
	    0000h successful
	    00A5h resource not available
Desc:	Returns a process handle to be used in other request blocks
Notes:	This function is a prerequisite to all AX=000Fh subfunctions which
	  expect a process handle in the request block
	Although subsequent calls from the same application return different
	  process handles, there seem to be no restrictions on how many times
	  an application may call this function (in fact, the code in the VINES
	  toolkit library always calls it before issueing other AX=000Fh calls)

Format of request block:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 03450)
 00h	WORD	0008h
 02h	WORD	magic number (FEFEh)
 04h	WORD	buffer for return code (set to 0 before calling)
 06h	WORD	reserved
 08h	WORD	reserved (obviously not used; set to 0 before calling)
 0Ah	DWORD	process type (1 = transient, 2 = resident; destroyed on exit)
 0Eh	WORD	buffer for process handle
