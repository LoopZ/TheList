INT 61 U - PC/TCP kernel v2.05+ - GET DEBUG INFORMATION
	AH = 00h
	DS:SI -> 216-byte buffer for network debugging information (see #03322)
Return: CF clear
	AX = 0000h
	buffer filled
Notes:	this call is not documented by FTP, Inc. for any version
	most of the information returned by this call is available via the
	  documented get_kernel_info or net_info commands.
