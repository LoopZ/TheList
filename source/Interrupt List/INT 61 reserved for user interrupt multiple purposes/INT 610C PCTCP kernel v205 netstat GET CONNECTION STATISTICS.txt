INT 61 u - PC/TCP kernel v2.05+ - "net_stat" - GET CONNECTION STATISTICS
	AH = 0Ch
	BX = network descriptor or one of the following:
	    FFFCh for kernel ICMP statistics (see #03459)
	    FFFDh for kernel UDP statistics (see #03458)
	    FFFEh for kernel IP statistics (see #03457)
	    FFFFh for kernel TCP statistics (see #03456)
	DS:DX -> 64-byte buffer
Return: CF clear if successful
	    buffer filled
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (see #03319)
Notes:	the fields filled in for a network descriptor depend on the protocol
	  family used by that descriptor's connection
	this function is not supported by Beame&Whiteside's BWPCTCP v3.0a shim
