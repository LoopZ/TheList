INT 10 - VIDEO - MSHERC.COM - GET VIDEO ADAPTER TYPE AND MODE
	AH = EFh
Return: DL = video adapter type
	    00h original Hercules
	    01h Hercules Plus	 (port 03BAh reads x001xxxxx)
	    02h Hercules InColor (port 03BAh reads x101xxxxx)
	    FFh not a Hercules-compatible card (port 03BAh bit 7 not pulsing)
	DH = memory mode byte
	    00h "half" mode
	    01h "full" mode
	    FFh not a Hercules-compatible card
Program: MSHERC.COM/QBHERC.COM is a support program for the Microsoft Quick
	  languages which makes their graphics libraries compatible with a
	  Hercules card by adding video modes 08h and 88h, and supporting
	  text in the new graphics modes.
Notes:	while in mode 08h or 88h, INT 10 supports the Hercules card much like
	  a CGA.
	MSHERC performs an installation check by setting DL=FFh and testing
	  whether it has been changed on return, which causes it to reinstall
	  itself when no HGC is present (or HGC emulation has temporarily been
	  disabled); a better installation check would be to use DX=80FFh and
	  check whether DX has been changed
	reportedly returns DH=00h on some not-entirely-Hercules-compatible
	  cards
