INT 10 - VIDEO - READ CHARACTER AND ATTRIBUTE AT CURSOR POSITION
	AH = 08h
	BH = page number (00h to number of pages - 1) (see #00010)
Return: AH = character's attribute (text mode only) (see #00014)
	AH = character's color (Tandy 2000 graphics mode only)
	AL = character
Notes:	for monochrome displays, a foreground of 1 with background 0 is
	  underlined
	the blink bit may be reprogrammed to enable intense background colors
	  using AX=1003h or by programming the CRT controller
	the foreground intensity bit (3) can be programmed to switch between
	  character sets A and B on EGA and VGA cards, thus enabling 512
	  simultaneous characters on screen.  In this case the bit's usual
	  function (intensity) is regularly turned off.
	in graphics modes, only characters drawn with white foreground pixels
	  are matched by the pattern-comparison routine
	on the Tandy 2000, BH=FFh specifies that the current page should be
	  used
	because of the IBM BIOS specifications, there may exist some clone
	  BIOSes which do not preserve SI or DI; the Novell DOS kernel
	  preserves SI, DI, and BP before many INT 10h calls to avoid problems
	  due to those registers not being preserved by the BIOS.
BUG:	some IBM PC ROM BIOSes destroy BP when in graphics modes
