INT 10 - VIDEO - WRITE CHARACTER ONLY AT CURSOR POSITION
	AH = 0Ah
	AL = character to display
	BH = page number (00h to number of pages - 1) (see #00010)
	    background color in 256-color graphics modes (ET4000)
	BL = attribute (PCjr, Tandy 1000 only) or color (graphics mode)
	    if bit 7 set in <256-color graphics mode, character is XOR'ed
	      onto screen
	CX = number of times to write character
Return: nothing
Notes:	all characters are displayed, including CR, LF, and BS
	replication count in CX may produce an unpredictable result in graphics
	  modes if it is greater than the number of positions remaining in the
	  current row
	With PhysTechSoft's PTS ROM-DOS the BH and CX values are ignored
	  on entry.
