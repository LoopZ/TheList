If you know of any information not in the list, or which is stated incorrectly,
please let me know!  This list would be a pale shadow of its current self if it
weren't for everybody's input.

Software developers are encouraged to check the list before assigning 
interrupts, and to provide me with a list of interrupt calls used (to help
prevent future interrupt conflicts).

I reply to all e-mail submissions.  If you do not receive a reply within
a reasonable time, send your message again, giving a better return path
(a surprising number of mailers do not insert a correct From: address!)

If you notice any mistakes or omissions, please let me know!  It is only with
YOUR help that the list can continue to grow at the current rate.  Please send
all changes to me rather than distributing a modified version of the list.

Please read the file INTERRUP.1ST before asking me any questions.  You may find
that they have already been addressed.

I reply to all e-mail submissions, but some of my replies bounce because of
bad return paths.  If you don't get a response from me within a reasonable
period of time, send it again with a better return path (many mailers are
improperly configured and do not produce a valid From: address).
