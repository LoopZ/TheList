INT 7F - Alloy NetWare Support Kit (ANSK) v2.2+ - INSTALLATION CHECK
Note:	a program may determine that it is running on an ANSK Slave by checking
	  the five bytes at F000h:0000h for the ASCIZ signature "ANSK"; this
	  address is RAM, and should not be written.  However, the above check
	  will not work on Slaves with <1MB RAM or those using the SLIM.SYS
	  device driver
