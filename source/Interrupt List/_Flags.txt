The use of -> instead of = signifies that the indicated register or register
pair contains a pointer to the specified item, rather than the item itself.
Register pairs (such as AX:BX) indicate that the item is split across the
registers, with the high-order half in the first register.

One or more letters may follow the interrupt number; they have the following
meanings:

	U - undocumented function
	u - partially documented function
	P - available only in protected mode
	R - available only in real or V86 mode
	C - callout or callback (usually hooked rather than called)
	O - obsolete (no longer present in current versions)
