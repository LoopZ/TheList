INT 67 - LIM EMS 4.0 - MOVE/EXCHANGE MEMORY REGION
	AH = 57h
	AL = subfunction
	    00h move memory region
	    01h exchange memory region
	DS:SI -> structure describing source and destination (see #03653)
Return: AH = status (see #03652)
Note:	source and destination may overlap for a move, in which case the copy
	  direction is chosen such that the destination receives an intact copy
	  of the source region

(Table 03652)
Values for EMS function status:
 00h	successful
 80h	internal error
 81h	hardware failure
 83h	invalid handle
 84h	undefined function requested
 8Ah	invalid logical page number encountered
 8Fh	undefined subfunction
 92h	successful, but a portion of the source region has been overwritten
 93h	length of source or destination region exceeds length of region
	  allocated to either source or destination handle
 94h	conventional and expanded memory regions overlap
 95h	offset within logical page exceeds size of logical page
 96h	region length exceeds 1M
 97h	source and destination EMS regions have same handle and overlap
 98h	memory source or destination type undefined
 A2h	attempted to wrap around 1M conventional address space

Format of EMS copy data:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 03653)
 00h	DWORD	region length in bytes
 04h	BYTE	source memory type
		00h conventional
		01h expanded
 05h	WORD	source handle (0000h if conventional memory)
 07h	WORD	source initial offset (within page if EMS, segment if convent)
 09h	WORD	source initial segment (conv mem) or logical page (EMS)
 0Bh	BYTE	destination memory type
		00h conventional
		01h expanded
 0Ch	WORD	destination handle
 0Eh	WORD	destination initial offset
 10h	WORD	destination initial segment or page
