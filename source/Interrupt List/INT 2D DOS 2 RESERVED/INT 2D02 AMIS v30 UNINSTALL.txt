INT 2D - AMIS v3.0+ - UNINSTALL
	AL = 02h
	AH = multiplex number for program
	DX:BX = return address for successful uninstall (may be	ignored by TSR)
Return: AL = status
	    00h not implemented (makes TSR non-compliant with specification)
	    01h unsuccessful
	    02h can not uninstall yet, will do so when able
	    03h safe to remove, but no resident uninstaller
		  (TSR still enabled)
		BX = segment of memory block with resident code
	    04h safe to remove, but no resident uninstaller
		  (TSR now disabled)
		BX = segment of memory block with resident code
	    05h not safe to remove now, try again later
	    06h disabled, but can not be removed from memory
		  because loaded from CONFIG.SYS
	    07h safe to remove, but no resident device-driver
		  uninstaller.	Caller must unlink device
		  drivers from DOS device chain as well as
		  unhooking interrupts and freeing memory
		BX = segment of memory block with resident code
	    FFh successful
	return at DX:BX with AX destroyed if successful and TSR honors
	  specific return address
Note:	this function is not valid unless a program is installed on the
	  specified multiplex number; use INT 2D/AL=00h to check
