INT 2D - AMIS v3.5+ - GET HOTKEYS
	AL = 05h
	AH = multiplex number for program
Return: AL = status
	    00h not implemented
	    FFh supported
		DX:BX -> hotkey list (see #02572)
Notes:	this function is not valid unless a program is installed on the
	  specified multiplex number; use INT 2D/AL=00h to check
	programs which provide hotkeys are required to provide this function
	  to be fully compliant with this specification
SeeAlso: INT 2D/AL=00h,INT 2D/AL=01h,INT 2D/AL=02h,INT 2D/AL=03h,INT 2D/AL=04h
SeeAlso: INT 2D/AL=06h

Format of AMIS hotkey list:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 02572)
 00h	BYTE	type of hotkey checking (see #02573)
 01h	BYTE	number of hotkeys (may be zero if TSR can disable hotkeys)
 02h 6N BYTEs	array of hotkey definitions
		(one per hotkey, first should be primary hotkey)
		Offset	Size	Description
		 00h	BYTE	hotkey scan code (00h/80h if shift states only)
				hotkey triggers on release if bit 7 set
		 01h	WORD	required shift states (see #02574)
		 03h	WORD	disallowed shift states (see #02574)
		 05h	BYTE	hotkey flags (see #02575)
Notes:	except for bit 7, the shift states correspond exactly to the return
	  values from INT 16/AH=12h.  A set bit in the required states word
	  indicates that the corresponding shift state must be active when the
	  hotkey's scan code is received for the hotkey to be recognized; a
	  clear bit means that the corresponding state may be ignored.	A set
	  bit in the disallowed shift states word indicates that the
	  corresponding shift state must be inactive.
	for the disallowed-states word, if one of the "either" bits is set,
	  then both the corresponding left bit and right bit must be set
	examples:
		Ctrl-Alt-Del monitoring: 53h 000Ch 0003h 06h
		Alt-key tap (DESQview):	 B8h 0000h 0007h 08h
		Shf-Shf-N (NOTE.COM):	 31h 0003h 000Ch 00h

Bitfields for type of AMIS hotkey checking:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 02573)
 0	checks before chaining INT 09
 1	checks after chaining INT 09
 2	checks before chaining INT 15/AH=4Fh
 3	checks after chaining INT 15/AH=4Fh
 4	checks on INT 16/AH=00h,01h,02h
 5	checks on INT 16/AH=10h,11h,12h
 6	checks on INT 16/AH=20h,21h,22h
 7	reserved (0)

Bitfields for AMIS shift states:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 02574)
 0	right shift pressed
 1	left shift pressed
 2	either control key pressed
 3	either Alt key pressed
 4	ScrollLock active
 5	NumLock active
 6	CapsLock active
 7	either shift key pressed
 8	left control key pressed
 9	left Alt key pressed
 10	right control key pressed
 11	right Alt key pressed
 12	ScrollLock pressed
 13	NumLock pressed
 14	CapsLock pressed
 15	SysReq key pressed
Notes:	if bit 2 is set, either control key may be pressed for the hotkey; if
	  bits 8 and 10 are both set, then both control keys must be pressed.
	  Similarly for bits 3 and 9/11, as well as 7 and 0/1.
	the SysReq key is often labeled SysRq

Bitfields for AMIS hotkey flags:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 02575)
 0	hotkey chained before processing
 1	hotkey chained after processing
 2	others should pass through this hotkey so that it can be monitored
 3	hotkey will not activate if other keys pressed/released before hotkey
	  press is completed
 4	this key is remapped into some other key
 5	this key is conditionally chained (sometimes passed on, sometimes
	  swallowed)
 6-7	reserved (0)
