INT 0D C - CPU-generated (80286+) - GENERAL PROTECTION VIOLATION
Desc:	the CPU generates this interrupt when it detects a protection violation
	  which does not fit under any other category having a separate
	  interrupt
Notes:	called in real mode when
	    an instruction accesses a memory operand extending beyond offset
	      FFFFh (i.e. WORD at FFFFh or DWORD at FFFDh or higher) in segment
	      CS, DS, ES, FG, or GS
	    a PUSH MEM or POP MEM instruction contains an invalid bit encoding
	      in the second byte
	    an instruction exceeds the maximum length allowed (10 bytes for
	      80286, 15 bytes for 80386/80486)
	    an instruction wraps from offset FFFFh to offset 0000h
	called in protected mode on protection violations not covered by INT 06
	  through INT 0C, including
	    segment limit violations
	    write to read-only segments
	    accesses using null DS or ES selectors
	    accesses to segments with privilege greater than CPL
	    wrong descriptor type
	called on 80486 protected-mode floating-point protection fault
