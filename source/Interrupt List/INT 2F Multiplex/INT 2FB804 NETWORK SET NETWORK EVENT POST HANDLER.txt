INT 2F - NETWORK - SET NETWORK EVENT POST HANDLER
	AX = B804h
	CX = (10NET) 0370h if 10Windows is hooking post handler
	ES:BX -> new event post handler (see #02981)
Notes:	used in conjunction with AX=B803h to hook into the network event post
	  routine
	this function is supported by PC LAN Program, 10NET v5.0,
	  NetSoft DOS-NET v1.20+
	The specified handler is called on any network event.  Two events are
	  defined: message received and critical network error.
SeeAlso: AX=B800h,AX=B803h,AX=B904h

(Table 02981)
Values network post routine is called with:
	AX = 0000h single block message
	    DS:SI -> ASCIZ originator name
	    DS:DI -> ASCIZ destination name
	    ES:BX -> text header (see #02982)
	AX = 0001h start multiple message block
	    CX = block group ID
	    DS:SI -> ASCIZ originator name
	    DS:DI -> ASCIZ destination name
	AX = 0002h multiple block text
	    CX = block group ID
	    ES:BX -> text header (see #02982)
	AX = 0003h end multiple block message
	    CX = block group ID
	AX = 0004h message aborted due to error
	    CX = block group ID
	AX = 0101h server received badly formatted network request
	    Return: AX = FFFFh (PC LAN will process error)
	AX = 0102h unexpected network error
	    ES:BX -> NCB (see #03249 at INT 5C"NetBIOS")
	AX = 0103h server received INT 24 error
	    other registers as for INT 24, except AH is in BH
	    Return: as below, but only 0000h and FFFFh allowed
Return: AX = response code
	    0000h user post routine processed message
	    0001h PC LAN will process message, but message window not displayed
	    FFFFh PC LAN will process message

Format of text header:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 02982)
 00h	WORD	length of text (maximum 512 bytes)
 02h  N BYTEs	text of message
Note:	all CRLF sequences in message text are replaced by 14h; all other
	  values below 20h (space) are reserved
