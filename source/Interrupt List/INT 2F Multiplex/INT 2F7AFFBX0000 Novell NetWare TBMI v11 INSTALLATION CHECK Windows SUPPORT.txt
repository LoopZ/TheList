INT 2F - Novell NetWare - TBMI v1.1+ - INSTALLATION CHECK / Windows SUPPORT
	AX = 7AFFh
	BX = 0000h
	CX = 4E65h ("Ne")
	DX = 7457h ("tW")
	ES:DI -> Windows support procedure (see #02926)
Return: AL = FFh if installed
	    CX = configured sockets (14h)
	    DS:SI -> data table ???
	    ES:DI -> IPX far call handler
Notes:	for IPX/SPX this call reportedly returns DS:SI pointing to the table
	  of pointers to service events queue head and tail
	this function is also supported by IPXODI; v2.12 does not change DS,
	  but does set SI to an internal address
SeeAlso: AX=7AFFh/BX=0001h

(Table 02926)
Values Windows support procedure called with:
	BP = function
	    0001h Get ECB
		BX = socket number
		Return: ES:SI -> ECB or 0000h:0000h if none available
	    0002h Count Listen ECBs
		AX = BX = socket
		Return: CX = number of listen ECBs for socket
				(must be >= 2 for SPX to work)
	    0003h ???
	    0004h Inform task switcher of ECB locations
		Note:	registers other than those listed above are equal
			  to the values when IPX was called
Note:	the support function will not be called if IPX is called with BX
	  bit 15 set
