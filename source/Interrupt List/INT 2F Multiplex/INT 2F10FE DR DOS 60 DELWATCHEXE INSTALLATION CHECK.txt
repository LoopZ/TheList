INT 2F U - DR DOS 6.0+ DELWATCH.EXE - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 10FEh
Return: AL = FFh if installed and active
	    AH = internal version number
	        10h for DR DOS 6.0 DELWATCH 1.0 / 1.1 (through 1993/03/19)
		20h for Novell DOS 7+ DELWATCH 2.0+
	    DX:BX -> private entry point (see #02605)
Notes:	The DR DOS 6.0 DELWATCH 1.x used to store information about deleted
	  files in a hidden file named @DLWATCH.DAT, however the Novell DOS 7+
	  DELWATCH 2.0+ stores all the info in previously unused fields in
	  the files' directory entries. (See table !!! at INT 21h/11h for
	  details). This, however, now causes problems on systems also running
	  Windows 9x since Microsoft decided to use a rather similar but
	  incompatible method to store long filenames etc. in these entries.
	Running DELWATCH 2.x on a system which previously used DELWATCH 1.x,
	  the @DLWATCH.DAT file will be abandoned and converted to the new
	  method.

Notes:	functions marked "OS hook" must under no circumstances by called by
	  external applications, as this would bypass the serialization
	  performed by the kernel and cause problems at least in multitasking
	  environments.
	two functions have been swapped between DELWATCH 1.x and DELWATCH 2.0
	  to ensure that DELWATCH 1.x calls will not do anything under newer
	  versions of the OS; for the same reason, the drive number in AL
	  sometimes requires that bit 7 be set for DELWATCH 2.0+.
