INT 2F CU - DOS 5+ - DOS SUPERVISOR "REBOOT PANEL" - ADJUST MEMORY SIZE
	AX = 4A06h
	DX = segment following last byte of conventional memory
Return: DX = segment following last byte of memory available for use by DOS
Desc:	used to override the default memory size when booting diskless
	  workstations
Notes:	called by MS-DOS 5+ IO.SYS and DR DOS 6.0+ IBMBIO.OCM startup code if
	  the signature "RPL" is present three bytes beyond the INT 2F handler;
	  this call overrides the value returned by INT 12
	hooked by RPL code at the top of memory to protect itself from being
	  overwritten; DOS builds a memory block with owner = 0008h and name
	  "RPL" which must be freed by the RPL code when it is done.
	  Under DR DOS, it is sufficient to set the owner field of the MCB to
	  0000h.
	In addition to the test for "RPL", DR PalmDOS (since 1992/08/25),
	  DR DOS 6.0 "Business update March 1993", DR DOS "Panther" and
	  "StarTrek", and Novell DOS 7+ also check for a "RPLOADER" signature.
	  If this 2nd signature is found, IBMBIO.COM will store the INT 2Fh
	  vector for later use after the BIOS init, when at several points it
	  directly calls the RPLOADER via an emulated INT 2Fh with
	  AX=12FFh/BX=5/CX=0/DX=1 and a phase code 1, 2 or 3 on the stack.
	  This permits the RPLOADER to keep track of the initialization
	  process and clean or fix up anything it wishes.  The "phase 1"
	  broadcast is issued after the BIOS init code and data have been
	  relocated (e.g. into the HMA), "phase 2" gets issued immediately
	  before the CONFIG.SYS processing begins and the DOS code and data
	  are relocated, and the closing "phase 3" happens to permit any
	  final tidy ups before the memory manager gets acknowledgement of
	  completion.
