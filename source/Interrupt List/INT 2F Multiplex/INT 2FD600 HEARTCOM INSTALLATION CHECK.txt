INT 2F - HEART.COM - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = D600h
Return: AX = 0303h (two hearts) if installed
	    ES:DI -> buffer (see #03088)
Program: HEART.COM is a CPU lock-up/critical indicator utility by Mitch Davis.
Notes:	Once the host program has identified the address of the data area, it
	  can change this to indicate safe/critical, alternate colours, etc.
	The entries for the color table are in char/attrib form.  Every two
	  entries form a pair which is alternated between 68 times a minute.
	  The first half of the table is for color videos, the second mono.
	  Within each half, the first half is for the safe chars, and the
	  second for the critical chars.

Format of HEART.COM buffer:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 03088)
 00h  8 WORDs	table of colors/attributes (refer to notes above)
 10h	BYTE	flags
		bit 0: program is in critical section, so flash double
		      exclamation mark
		bit 1: program is in safe code, so flash the heart character
 11h	WORD	position of heartbeat on screen, normally 009Eh (last column
		of second line)
