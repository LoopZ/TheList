INT 2F C - DOS 5+ TASK SWITCHER - BUILD CALLOUT CHAIN
	AX = 4B01h
	CX:DX -> task switcher entry point (see #02819)
	ES:BX = 0000h:0000h
Return: ES:BX -> callback info structure (see #02817) or 0000h:0000h
Notes:	called by the task switcher
	this function is hooked by clients which require notification of task
	  switcher activities; the call must first be passed on to the prior
	  handler with registers unchanged using a simulated interrupt.	 On
	  return, the client must build a callback info structure and store
	  the returned ES:BX in the "next" field, then return the address of
	  its own callback info structure.
	a client program must add itself to the notification chain if it
	  provides services to other programs; before terminating, it must
	  remove itself from the chain by calling the task switcher's entry
	  point with AX=0005h (see #02819)
	the task switcher entry point should not be saved, as it is subject to
	  change and will be provided on any notification call
	the Windows 3.1 Standard Mode supports this API

Format of task switcher callback info structure:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 02817)
 00h	DWORD	pointer to next callback info structure
 04h	DWORD	pointer to notification function (see #02818)
 08h	DWORD	reserved
 0Ch	DWORD	address of zero-terminated list of API info structures
		(see #02821)

(Table 02818)
Values task switcher notification function is called with:
	AX = function
	    0000h switcher initialization
		Return: AX = status
			    0000h if OK to load
			    nonzero to abort task switcher
	    0001h query suspend
		BX = session ID
		Return: AX = status
			    0000h if OK to switch session
			    0001h if not
	    0002h suspend session
		BX = session ID
		interrupts disabled
		Return: AX = 0000h if OK to switch session
			   = 0001h if not
	    0003h activate session
		BX = session ID
		CX = session status flags
			bit 0: set if first activation of session
			bits 1-15: reserved (0)
		interrupts disabled
		Return: AX = 0000h
	    0004h session active
		BX = session ID
		CX = session status flags
			bit 0: set if first activation of session
			bits 1-15: reserved (0)
		Return: AX = 0000h
	    0005h create session
		BX = session ID
		Return: AX = 0000h if OK to create session
			   = 0001h if not
	    0006h destroy session
		BX = session ID
		Return: AX = 0000h
	    0007h switcher termination
		BX = flags
		    bit 0: set if calling switcher is only switcher loaded
		    bits 1-15: reserved (0)
		Return: AX = 0000h
	ES:DI -> task switcher entry point (see #02819)
Notes:	function 0000h is generally called by the program which controls or
	  invokes the task switcher, rather than by the task switcher itself;
	  the entry point supplied to this function is not necessarily the
	  entry point to the task switcher itself, and may be 0000h:0000h.  If
	  any client indicates that loading is not possible, all clients will
	  be called with function 0007h; thus it is possible for a client to
	  receive a termination notice without a corresponding initialization
	  notice.
	except for functions 0002h and 0003h, the notification handler is
	  called with interrupts enabled and may make any INT 21h function
	  call; interrupts must not be enabled in functions 0002h and 0003h
	function 0007h may be called with ES:DI = 0000h:0000h if the entry
	  point is no longer valid
