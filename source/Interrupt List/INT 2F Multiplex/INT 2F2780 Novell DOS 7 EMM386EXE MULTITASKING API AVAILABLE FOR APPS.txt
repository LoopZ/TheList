INT 2F U - Novell DOS 7 - EMM386.EXE - MULTITASKING API - AVAILABLE FOR APPS
	AX = 2780h
	CL = function (07h-0Fh)
	???
Return: ???
Notes:	called by DPMS.EXE and EMM386.EXE
	the handlers for each of these functions may be set individually by
	  one of the subfunctions of AX=2780h/CL=01h; the default handlers
	  return with all registers unchanged
	this API is only available if AX=12FFh/BX=0EDCh returns successfully;
	  because the request is handled on the initial trap to the memory
	  manager caused by INT instructions, this API must be invoked with
	  an actual INT 2F instruction instead of some simulation such as a
	  far call to the address in the interrupt vector table
