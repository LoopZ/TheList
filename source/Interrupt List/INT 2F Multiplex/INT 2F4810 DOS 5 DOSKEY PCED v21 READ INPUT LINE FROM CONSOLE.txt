INT 2F - DOS 5+ DOSKEY, PCED v2.1 - READ INPUT LINE FROM CONSOLE
	AX = 4810h
	DS:DX -> line buffer (see #01344 at INT 21/AH=0Ah)
Return: AX = 0000h if successful
Notes:	the first byte (length) of the buffer MUST be 80h, or MS-DOS's DOSKEY
	  chains to the previous handler; PCED and Novell DOS allow sizes
	  other than 80h
	if the user's input is a macro name, no text is placed in the buffer
	  even though AX=0000h on return; the program must immediately issue
	  this call again to retrieve the expansion of the macro.  Similarly,
	  if the user enters a special parameter such as $*, this call must
	  be repeated to retrieve the expansion; on the second call, DOSKEY
	  overwrites the macro name on the screen with its expansion.
	unlike DOSKEY, PCED expands all macros on the first call, so it is
	  not necessary to make two calls; since the buffer is not empty on
	  return, DOSKEY-aware programs will not make the second call
	DOSKEY chains if AL is not 00h or 10h on entry
	this function is supported by Novell DOS 7 DOSKEY
