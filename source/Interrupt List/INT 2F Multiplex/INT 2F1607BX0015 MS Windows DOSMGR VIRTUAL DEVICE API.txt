INT 2F C - MS Windows - "DOSMGR" VIRTUAL DEVICE API
	AX = 1607h
	BX = 0015h (VxD identifier of "DOSMGR")
	CX = function
	    0000h query instance processing
		DX = 0000h
		Return: CX = state
			    0000h not instanced
			    other instanced (DOS 5+ kernel returns 0001h)
				DX = segment of DOS drivers or 0000h for
					default of 0070h
				ES:BX -> patch table (see #02637)
	    0001h set patches in DOS
		DX = bit mask of patch requests (see #02636)
		Return: AX = B97Ch
			BX = bit mask of patches applied (see #02636)
			DX = A2ABh
	    0002h remove patches in DOS (ignored by DOS 5.0 kernel)
		DX = bit mask of patch requests (see #02636)
		Return: CX = 0000h (DOS 5-6)
		Note:	return values are ignored by DOSMGR in Windows 3.1
	    0003h get size of DOS data structures
		DX = bit mask of request (only one bit can be set)
		    bit 0: Current Directory Structure size
		Return: if supported request:
			    AX = B97Ch
			    CX = size in bytes of requested structure
			    DX = A2ABh
			else:
			    CX = 0000h
			    all other registers preserved
	    0004h determine instanced data structures
		Return: AX = B97Ch if supported
			DX = A2ABh if supported (DOS 5+ kernel returns 0000h)
			BX = bit mask of instanced items
			    bit 0: CDS
			    bit 1: SFT
			    bit 2: device list
			    bit 3: DOS swappable data area
	    0005h get device driver size
		ES = segment of device driver
		Return: DX:AX = 0000h:0000h on error (not dev. driver segment)
			DX:AX = A2ABh:B97Ch if successful
			    BX:CX = size of device driver in bytes
Notes:	DOSMGR (DOS Manager) will check whether the OEM DOS/BIOS data has
	  been instanced via this API and will not perform its own default
	  instancing of the normal DOS/BIOS data if so; if this API is not
	  supported, DOSMGR will also try to access instancing data through
	  INT 2F/AX=1603h
	these functions are supported by the DOS 5+ kernel; DOSMGR contains
	  tables of instancing information for earlier versions of DOS
	see Geoff Chappell's book _DOS_Internals_ for additional discussions of
	  DOSMGR's behavior and instancing in general

Bitfields for DOSMGR patch requests:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 02636)
 0	enable critical sections
 1	NOP setting/checking user ID
 2	turn INT 21/AH=3Fh on STDIN into polling loop
 3	trap stack fault in "SYSINIT" to WIN386
 4	BIOS patch to trap "Insert disk X:" to WIN386

Format of DOSMGR patch table:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 02637)
 00h  2 BYTEs	DOS version (major, minor)
 02h	WORD	offset in DOS data segment of "SAVEDS"
 04h	WORD	offset in DOS data segment of "SAVEBX"
 06h	WORD	offset in DOS data segment of InDOS flag
 08h	WORD	offset in DOS data segment of User ID word
 0Ah	WORD	offset in DOS data segment of "CritPatch" table to enable
		  critical section calls (see INT 2A/AH=80h)
 0Ch	WORD	(DOS 5+ only) offset in DOS data segment of "UMB_HEAD",
		  containing segment of last MCB in conventional memory
