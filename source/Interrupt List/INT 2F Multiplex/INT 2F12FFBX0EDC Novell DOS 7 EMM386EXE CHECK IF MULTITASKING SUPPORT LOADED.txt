INT 2F U - Novell DOS 7 - EMM386.EXE - CHECK IF MULTITASKING SUPPORT LOADED???
	AX = 12FFh
	BX = 0EDCh ('EDC' = Novell European Development Center)
Return: AX = 0000h if ??? loaded
	    CF clear
	    BX = 0000h
Notes:	called by Novell DOS 7 TaskMgr
	if this function returns with AX=0000h, then the code necessary to
	  support the API on INT 2F/AX=2780h is loaded and that API becomes
	  available for use
	because the request is handled on the initial trap to the memory
	  manager caused by INT instructions, this function must be invoked
	  with an actual INT 2F instruction instead of some simulation such
	  as a far call to the address in the interrupt vector table
