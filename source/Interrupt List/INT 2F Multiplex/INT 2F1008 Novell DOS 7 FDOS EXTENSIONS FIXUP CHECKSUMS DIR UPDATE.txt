INT 2F CU - Novell DOS 7+ FDOS EXTENSIONS - FIXUP CHECKSUMS / DIR UPDATE???
	AX = 1008h
	BX = segment of directory buffer
	CX = cluster to fixup (0 = root)
	DI = directory entry index (truncated to cluster if subdirectory)
	BX:SI -> directory entry (single entry for hashing)
Return:	nothing
Notes:	This private function is called internally by the OS kernel to
	  ask the FDOS to fixup hashing/checksums.  By using the
	  INT 2F/AX=1001h FDOS hook, the call can be intercepted by external
	  system components such as the DELWATCH TSR.
	This function must under no circumstances be called by applications!
