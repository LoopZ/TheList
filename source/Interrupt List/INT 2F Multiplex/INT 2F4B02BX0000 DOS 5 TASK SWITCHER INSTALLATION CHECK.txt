	AX = 4B02h
	BX = 0000h
	ES:DI = 0000h:0000h
Return: ES:DI = 0000h:0000h if task switcher not loaded

	    AX = 0000h
Notes:	the returned entry point is that for the most-recently loaded task
	  switcher; the entry points for prior task switchers may be determined
	  with the "get version" call (see #02819)
	this function is supported by PC Tools v8+ CPTASK
