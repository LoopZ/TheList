INT 2F U - Novell NWCACHE - INSTALLATION CHECK AND STATISTICS
	AX = 4A10h
	BX = 0000h
	CX = magic value
	    0EDCh flush delayed writes
		('EDC' = Novell European Development Center)
	    other (use EBABh to avoid SMARTDRV/DBLSPACE interaction)
Return: (also refer to notes below)
	AX = 6756h ('gV') if installed
	    CF clear
	    BX = cache memory type
		01h conventional memory
		02h extended memory
		03h EMS
	    DI:SI = cache misses
	    CX:DX = segment:offset address of data area containing statistics
		  (see #04095)
	    BP = version in BCD 
		0100h = 1.00
		0101h = 1.01 & 1.02 (!)
Notes:	SMARTDRV 4.0+ uses a similar installation check on this function but
	  returns different data.  To ensure proper interpretation of
	  the returned values, the caller must check the returned magic
	  value in AX. Since SMARTDRV may also alter DI:SI (and possibly
	  DS), the caller should take care of this, too.
	The Novell DOS / DR-DOS 7.x COMMAND.COM invokes this function with
	  CX=0EDCh, which causes NWCACHE to flush any delayed writes before
	  returning the normal register values if it is configured to flush
	  writes before returning to the DOS prompt (/FLUSH:ON); however, if
	  /FLUSH:OFF, this function becomes a NOP with CX=0EDCh.
	Note that for this function the 0EDCh special case may vanish with
	  future issues of NWCACHE (2.0+), and the function would then always
	  do the normal install check, and not flush the cache.
