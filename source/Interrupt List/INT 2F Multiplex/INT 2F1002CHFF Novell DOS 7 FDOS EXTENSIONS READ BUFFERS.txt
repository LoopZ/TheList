INT 2F CU - Novell DOS 7+ FDOS EXTENSIONS - READ BUFFERS
	AX = 1002h
	CH = FFh (pre-read required)
	CL = buffer type (here FAT, DIR, or DATA, see below)
	AH:DX = 24 bit sector number
Return:	ES:SI -> buffer control block
Notes:	This private function is called internally by the OS kernel to
	  ask the FDOS to find the corresponding buffer.  By using the
	  INT 2F/AX=1001h FDOS hook, the call can be intercepted by external
	  system components such as the DELWATCH TSR.
	This function must under no circumstances be called by applications!
