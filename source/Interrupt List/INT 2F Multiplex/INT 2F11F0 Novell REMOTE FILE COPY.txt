INT 2F - Novell ??? - REMOTE FILE COPY
	AX = 11F0h
	SI = source file handle
	DI = destination file handle
	DX:CX = number of bytes to copy, starting at current file position
	CF cleared
Return: CF clear:
	    AX = 11F0h	"no network there"
	    AX <> 11F0h if successful
	CF set on error "the request could not be handled"
	    AX = error code (05h,06h,0Bh,11h,3Bh) (see #01680)
	DX:CX = number of bytes successfully copied (file position updated)
Notes:	From the DR DOS "Panther" BETA COMMAND.COM (1992/06/22) up to some of
	  the Novell DOS 7 COMMAND.COM updates (1994/09/12), the shell made
	  calls to INT 2F/AX=11F0h to attempt "remote server COPYing". However,
	  this was removed from later releases of the shell because it 
	  interfered with Performance Technologies' PowerLAN 3.1. (A successor
	  of the DR-DOS 7.03 COMMAND.COM may possibly reintroduce this remote
	  copy feature. Probably it would then try both INT 2F/AX=1127h and
	  INT 2F/AX=11F0h.)
