INT 2F C - DESQview v2.26+ External Dev Interface - CHANGE KEYBOARD FOCUS
	AX = DE0Ah
	BX = mapping context of task receiving focus
	DX = handle of running task
Notes:	driver should pass this call to previous handler before processing it
	this call often occurs inside a keyboard interrupt
	DV 2.42 does not provide this call to XDI handlers running inside a
	  window; instead, it directly calls the INT 2F handler which was
	  active at the time DV started
