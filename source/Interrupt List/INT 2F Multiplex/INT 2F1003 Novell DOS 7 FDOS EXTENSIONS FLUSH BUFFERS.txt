INT 2F CU - Novell DOS 7+ FDOS EXTENSIONS - FLUSH BUFFERS
	AX = 1003h
	BL = drive???
	BH = buffer type to flush (BF_ISFAT+BF_ISDIR+BF_ISDATA)
Return: nothing???
Notes:	This private function is called internally by the OS kernel to
	  ask the FDOS to flush all buffer.  By using the INT 2F/AX=1001h FDOS
	  hook, the call can be intercepted by external system components such
	  as the DELWATCH TSR.
	This function must under no circumstances be called by applications!
