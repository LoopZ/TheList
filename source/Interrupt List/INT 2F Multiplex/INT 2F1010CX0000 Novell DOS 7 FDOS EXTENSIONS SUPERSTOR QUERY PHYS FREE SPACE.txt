INT 2F CU - Novell DOS 7+ FDOS EXTENSIONS - SUPERSTOR - QUERY PHYS FREE SPACE
	AX = 1010h
	CX = 0000h
Return: CX = free space
	    0000h if no physical space left on the drive
	    else there is still space available
Notes:	This private function is internally called by the FDOS part of the
	  OS kernel on "out of disk space" conditions.  It allows optimized
	  behaviour of DELWATCH delete tracking software in conjunction with
	  disk compression, and was implemented for SuperStor (but it would
	  also work with other disk compression if they hook this function).
	  If there truly is no physical space left on the drive, the FDOS asks
	  DELWATCH to purge files in its queue until enough space has been
	  freed, or there actually is no free disk space any more.
	By using the INT 2F/AX=1001h FDOS hook, the call can be intercepted by
	  external system components such as SuperStor, bundled with DR DOS
	  "Panther" and Novell DOS 7 BETAs.
	This function must under no circumstances be called by applications!
