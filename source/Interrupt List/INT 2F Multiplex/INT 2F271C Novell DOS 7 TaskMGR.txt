  Category: T 	DOS-based task switchers/multitaskers
      Flag: U 	undocumented function

INT 2F U - Novell DOS 7 TaskMGR - ???
	AX = 271Ch
	DX = ???
	    bit 0: ???
Return: ???
	---if DX bit 0 set---
	AX = 0031h
	CX = 0000h
BUG:	if the task switcher is running, and DX bit 0 is set on call, this
	  function will crash because its exit code attempts to pop several
	  registers which are not pushed when DX bit 0 is set
