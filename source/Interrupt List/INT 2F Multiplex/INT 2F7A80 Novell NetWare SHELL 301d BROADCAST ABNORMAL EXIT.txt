INT 2F C - Novell NetWare - SHELL 3.01d BROADCAST - ABNORMAL EXIT
	AX = 7A80h
Return: nothing
Notes:	called on abnormal exit of the NetWare shell to notify other Novell
	  TSRs that it is unsafe to call the shell in the future; also called
	  by NETX.VLM when it is unloaded
	must be passed through so that all interested programs see the exit
	on receiving this call, IPXODI clears an internal pointer to a
	  default value; Novell's NETBIOS.EXE clears its INT 21h pointer to
	  0000h:0000h and stops calling it
