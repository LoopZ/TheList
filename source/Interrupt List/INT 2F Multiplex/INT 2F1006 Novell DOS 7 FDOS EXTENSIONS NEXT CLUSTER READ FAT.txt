INT 2F CU - Novell DOS 7+ FDOS EXTENSIONS - NEXT CLUSTER / READ FAT???
	AX = 1006h
	BX = current cluster number
Return:	AX or BX??? = next cluster in chain
Notes:	This private function is called internally by the OS kernel to
	  ask the FDOS to get the next cluster in a file.  By using the
	  INT 2F/AX=1001h FDOS hook, the call can be intercepted by external
	  system components such as the DELWATCH TSR.
	This function must under no circumstances be called by applications!
