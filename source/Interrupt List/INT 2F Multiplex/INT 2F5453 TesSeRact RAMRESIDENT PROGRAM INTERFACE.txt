Notes:	Borland's THELP.COM popup help system for Turbo Pascal and Turbo C
	  (versions 1.x and 2.x only) fully supports the TesSeRact API, as
	  do the SWAP?? programs by Innovative Data Concepts.
	AVATAR.SYS supports functions 00h and 01h (only the first three fields
	  of the user parameter block) using the name "AVATAR  "
