INT 58 C - TI Professional PC - SYSTEM TIMER 25ms HOOK
Desc:	called from the hardware timer tick interrupt, after executing the
	  first four BIOS timing events, updating the system clock, invoking
	  INT 5A if required, saving registers, and switching to a temporary
	  stack (the one reserved for IRQ3)
Notes:	the handler for this interrupt may destroy AX,BX,DI,ES but must
	  preserve all other registers; 8 WORDs of stack space are available,
	  of which at most 4 may be used if the handler enables interrupts
	if the handler switches stacks (because more than 4/8 WORDs are
	  required), the original stack must be restored before chaining to
	  the previous handler
