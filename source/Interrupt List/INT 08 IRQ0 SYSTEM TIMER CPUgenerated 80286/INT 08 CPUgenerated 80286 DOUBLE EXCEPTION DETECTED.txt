INT 08 C - CPU-generated (80286+) - DOUBLE EXCEPTION DETECTED
Desc:	called when multiple exceptions occur on one instruction, or an
	  exception occurs in an exception handler
Notes:	called in protected mode if an interrupt above the defined limit of
	  the interrupt vector table occurs
	return address points at beginning of instruction with errors or the
	  beginning of the instruction which was about to execute when the
	  external interrupt caused the exception
	if an exception occurs in the double fault handler, the CPU goes into
	  SHUTDOWN mode (which circuitry in the PC/AT converts to a reset);
	  this "triple fault" is a faster way of returning to real mode on
	  many 80286 machines than the standard keyboard controller reset
