INT 15 - DESQview v2.26+ - "DISPATCHINT" - INTERRUPT ANOTHER TASK
	AX = DE20h
	BX = segment of handle of task to interupt
	DX:CX -> FAR interrupt routine
	BP,SI,DI,DS,ES as required by interrupt routine
Return: nothing
Notes:	unlike "PGMINT" (AX=1021h), DISPATCHINT may be applied to the task
	  making the DISPATCHINT call
	multiple "DISPATCHINT" calls are processed in the order in which they
	  were executed
	the FAR routine is entered with the current ES, DS, SI, DI, and BP
	  values, using the task's internal stack (see AX=101Ah); only SS:SP
	  needs to be preserved
	this API call may be made from within a hardware interrupt handler
