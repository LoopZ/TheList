INT 15 - Advanced Power Management v1.0+ - CPU IDLE
	AX = 5305h
Return: CF clear if successful (after system leaves idle state)
	CF set on error
	    AH = error code (03h,0Bh) (see #00473)
Notes:	call when the system is idle and should be suspended until the next
	  system event or interrupt
	should not be called from within a hardware interrupt handler to avoid
	  reentrance problems
	if an interrupt causes the system to resume normal processing, the
	  interrupt may or may not have been handled when the BIOS returns
	  from this call; thus, the caller should allow interrupts on return
	interrupt handlers may not retain control if the BIOS allows
	  interrupts while in idle mode even if they are able to determine
	  that they were called from idle mode
	the caller should issue this call continuously in a loop until it needs
	  to perform some processing of its own
