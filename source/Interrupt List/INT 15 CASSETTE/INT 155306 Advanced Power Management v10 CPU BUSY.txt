INT 15 - Advanced Power Management v1.0+ - CPU BUSY
	AX = 5306h
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AH = error code (03h,0Bh) (see #00473)
Notes:	called to ensure that the system runs at full speed even on systems
	  where the BIOS is unable to recognize increased activity (especially
	  if interrupts are hooked by other programs and not chained to the
	  BIOS)
	this call may be made even when the system is already running at full
	  speed, but it will create unnecessary overhead
	should not be called from within a hardware interrupt handler to avoid
	  reentrance problems
