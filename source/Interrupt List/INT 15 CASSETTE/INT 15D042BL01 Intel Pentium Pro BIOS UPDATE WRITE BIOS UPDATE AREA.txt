INT 15 R - Intel Pentium Pro BIOS UPDATE - WRITE BIOS UPDATE AREA
	AX = D042h
	BL = 01h
	ES:DI -> microcode update block (see #00533)
	CX,DX,SI = segments of three 64K scratchpad areas for BIOS use
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	AH = status (see #00532)
	AL = OEM error (if AH is not 00h or 86h, otherwise undefined)
	    00h successful
Notes:	a microcode update may also be initiated by a WRMSR instruction
	  with ECX=0079h, EDX=00000000h, and EAX=linear address of update
	  block (see #00533)
	at least 32K stack space must be available when this function is called

(Table 00532)
Values for Pentium Pro BIOS update status:
 00h	successful
 86h	not implemented
 90h	unable to erase NVRAM device
 91h	unable to write to NVRAM device
 92h	unable to read storage
 93h	NVRAM is full
 94h	specified processor stepping is not present in system
 95h	invalid header or loader version
 96h	wrong checksum in header
 97h	processor rejected the update
 98h	the same or a more recent update is already stored
 99h	update block number was out of range

Format of Pentium Pro microcode update block:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 00533)
 00h	DWORD	update header version number (currently 00000001h)
		FFFFFFFFh = unused block
 04h	DWORD	revision number of this microcode update
 08h	DWORD	update creation date, as BCD mmddyyyy (month,day,year)
 0Ch	DWORD	family/model/stepping of processor to which update applied
		(same value as returned by CPUID instruction)
 10h	DWORD	checksum (used to force sum of all 512 DWORDs of the update
		block to 00000000h)
 14h	DWORD	revision number of loader needed to install update
		(currently 00000001h)
 18h 24 BYTEs	reserved for future expansion
 30h 2000 BYTEs	encrypted microcode data
