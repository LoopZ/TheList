INT 15 - Advanced Power Management v1.0+ - GET POWER MANAGEMENT EVENT
	AX = 530Bh
Return: CF clear if successful
	    BX = event code (see #00479)
	    CX = event information (APM v1.2) if BX=0003h or BX=0004h
		bit 0: PCMCIA socket was powered down in suspend state
	CF set on error
	    AH = error code (03h,0Bh,80h) (see #00473)
Notes:	although power management events are often asynchronous, notification
	  will not be made until polled via this call to permit software to
	  only receive event notification when it is prepared to process
	  power management events; since these events are not very time-
	  critical, it should be sufficient to poll once or twice per second
	the critical resume notification is made after the system resumes
	  from an emergency suspension; normally, the system BIOS only notifies
	  its partner that it wishes to suspend and relies on the partner to
	  actually request the suspension, but no notification is made on an
	  emergency suspension
	should not be called from within a hardware interrupt handler to avoid
	  reentrance problems
