INT 15 - DESQview v2.26+ - "PROCESSMEM" - GET TASK MEMORY STATUS
	AX = DE22h
	DX = segment of task handle
Return: DX = total amount of memory in paragraphs
	BX = amount of system memory in paragraphs
	CX = largest block of system memory available in paragraphs
	AX = memory flags (see #00552)
Notes:	if the task handle is a child task, the returned values will be for the
	  process containing the task, rather than the task itself
	if the process's system memory is swapped out, BX,CX,DX remain
	  unchanged, because the memory usage cannot be determined
