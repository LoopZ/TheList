INT 15 - HP OmniShare - STANDBY.COM - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = BA20h
Return: CF clear if successful (installed)
	CF set on error (not installed)
Notes:	The display controller can enter a standby mode after a given timeout,
	  to conserve power or (for the OmniShare) to increase the life of
	  the backlight.
	A side effect of standby mode is that the communications LED turns on
	  automatically when the display is in standby mode.  This is done in
	  hardware, and is intended to show that the unit is still on.
