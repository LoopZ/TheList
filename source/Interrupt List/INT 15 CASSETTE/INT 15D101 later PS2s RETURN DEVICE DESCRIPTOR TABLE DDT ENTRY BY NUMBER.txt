INT 15 - later PS/2s - RETURN DEVICE DESCRIPTOR TABLE (DDT) ENTRY BY NUMBER
	AX = D101h
	BX = number of requested entry (starting with 1)
	DX = 0000h (reserved, must be set to 0)
	ES:DI -> buffer to contain DDT entry (see #00535)
Return: AH = return code (see #00534)
	CF set on error
	CF clear on success
	    ES:DI buffer filled with DDT entry

Format of Device Descriptor Table (DDT):
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 00535)
 00h	BYTE	bits 7-4: reserved (set to 0)
		bits 3-0: slot of device (0 = system board)
 01h	BYTE	bits 7-4: second interrupt for this device (0 = none)
		bits 3-0: first interrupt for this device (0 = none)
 02h	BYTE	bits 7-4: second arbitration level for this device
		bits 3-0: first arbitration level for this device
 03h	WORD	DDT indicators (see #00536)
 05h	BYTE	reserved (0)
 06h	WORD	device ID (0 = none)
 08h	WORD	starting address of first  I/O block (0 = none)
 0Ah	WORD	starting address of second I/O block (0 = none)
 OCh	WORD	starting address of third  I/O block (0 = none)
 OEh	DWORD	start of first non-system memory block (0 = none)
 12h	WORD	size of first non-system memory block (in kilobytes)
 14h	DWORD	start of second non-system memory block (0 = none)
 18h	WORD	size of second non-system memory block (in kilobytes)
 1Ah	BYTE	implementation identifier of the device
 1Bh	BYTE	implementation revision level of the device
Note:	I/O block addresses and non-system memory addresses are listed in
	  ascending order in each DDT entry.

Bitfields for DDT indicators:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 00536)
 15	reserved (0)
 14	second arbitration level exists
 13	first arbitration level exists
 12	serial interface is RS-422
 11	not address limited
 10	DMA channel used
 9	second arbitration level can be shared
 8	first arbitration level can be shared
 7-0	reserved (0)
