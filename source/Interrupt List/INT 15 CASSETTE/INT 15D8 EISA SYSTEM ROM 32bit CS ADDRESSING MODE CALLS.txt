INT 15 - EISA SYSTEM ROM - 32-bit CS ADDRESSING MODE CALLS
	AH = D8h
	AL = 80h to 84h
	other registers as appropriate for AL=00h to 04h
Return: as appropriate for AL=00h to 04h
Note:	these functions are identical to AX=D800h to D804h, except that they
	  should be called when using 32-bit CS addressing mode (pointers use
	  ESI rather than SI as offset) instead of 16-bit addressing mode
