INT 15 - TopView - SEND MESSAGE - "APPLY" - WRITE PANEL TO WINDOW
	AH = 12h
	BX = 0400h
	STACK: DWORD handle of panel object
	       DWORD window's handle (or 0 for current task's window)
	       DWORD length of panel name
	       DWORD pointer to panel name
Return: STACK: DWORD handle of window which was used
	       DWORD handle of keyboard or 0
Notes:	status of APPLY may be checked with STATUS message
	panel MUST have the following format
	  first byte must be 1Bh (i.e. must start with a stream)
	  first opcode in stream must be E5h
	    single byte arg of opcode is interpreted thus:
	      bits 7,6	11 means create new window
			10 means create new field table for existing window
			01 means use existing window and field table
	      bit 5 if set, panel contains a field table
			(creates a new keyboard and puts it in field mode)
	      bit 4 if set, panel contains input fields
	      bit 3 if set, panel contains select fields but no input fields
	if the panel contains input or select fields, a keyboard handle is
	  returned; either the window's current open keyboard or a
	  newly-created keyboard object.  The caller should read that keyboard
	  to obtain input from the panel.
