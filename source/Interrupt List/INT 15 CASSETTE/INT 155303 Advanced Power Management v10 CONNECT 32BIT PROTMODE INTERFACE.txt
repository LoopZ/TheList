INT 15 - Advanced Power Management v1.0+ - CONNECT 32-BIT PROTMODE INTERFACE
	AX = 5303h
	BX = device ID of system BIOS (0000h)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = real-mode segment base address of protected-mode 32-bit code
		segment
	    EBX = offset of entry point
	    CX = real-mode segment base address of protected-mode 16-bit code
		segment
	    DX = real-mode segment base address of protected-mode 16-bit data
		segment
	    ---APM v1.1---
	    SI = APM BIOS code segment length
	    DI = APM BIOS data segment length
	CF set on error
	    AH = error code (02h,05h,07h,08h,09h) (see #00473)
Notes:	the caller must initialize three consecutive descriptors with the
	  returned segment base addresses for 32-bit code, 16-bit code, and
	  16-bit data, respectively; these descriptors must be valid whenever
	  the protected-mode interface is called, and will have their limits
	  arbitrarily set to 64K.
	the protected mode interface is invoked by making a far call to the
	  32-bit code segment with the same register values as for INT 15; it
	  must be invoked while CPL=0, the code segment descriptor must have a
	  DPL of 0, the stack must be in a 32-bit segment and have enough room
	  for BIOS use and possible interrupts, and the current I/O permission
	  bit map must allow access to the I/O ports used for power management.
	functions 00h-03h are not available from protected mode
	on connection, an APM v1.1 or v1.2 BIOS switches to APM v1.0
	  compatibility mode until it is informed that the user supports a
	  newer version of APM (see AX=530Eh)
