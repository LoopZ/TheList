INT 25 - Stacker - GET DEVICE DRIVER ADDRESS
	AX = CDCDh
	DS:BX -> buffer for address (see #02549)
	CX = 0001h
	DX = 0000h
Return: AX = CDCDh if Stacker installed
	    DS:BX buffer filled
Note:	not supported by Stacker Anywhere; to obtain the Stacker device
	  driver address and to detect drives controlled by all versions
	  of Stacker, INT 21/AX=4404h"Stacker" or lookup via the CDS and DPB
	  should be preferred (see INT 21/AH=52h)
	Stacker Anywhere does not link its built-in device driver into
	  the standard device driver chain, but it can be found via CDS/DPB
