INT 21 - DOS 1+ - PARSE FILENAME INTO FCB
	AH = 29h
	AL = parsing options (see #01380)
	DS:SI -> filename string (both '*' and '?' wildcards OK)
	ES:DI -> buffer for unopened FCB
Return: AL = result code
	    00h successful parse, no wildcards encountered
	    01h successful parse, wildcards present
	    FFh failed (invalid drive specifier)
	DS:SI -> first unparsed character
	ES:DI buffer filled with unopened FCB (see #01345)
Notes:	asterisks in the name are expanded to question marks in the FCB
	all processing stops when a filename terminator is encountered
	cannot be used with filespecs which include a path (DOS 2+)
	Novell NetWare monitors the result code since an 'invalid drive' may
	  signal an attempt to reconnect a network drive; if there are no
	  connections to the specified drive, NetWare attempts to build a
	  connection and map the drive to the SYS:LOGIN directory
