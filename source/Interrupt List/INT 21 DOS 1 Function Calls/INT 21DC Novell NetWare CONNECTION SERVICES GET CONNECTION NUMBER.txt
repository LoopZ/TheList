INT 21 - Novell NetWare - CONNECTION SERVICES - GET CONNECTION NUMBER
	AH = DCh
Return: AL = logical connection number
	    00h if NetWare not loaded or this machine is a non-dedicated server
	CX = station number in ASCII (CL = first digit)
Notes:	this function is supported by NetWare 4.0+, Banyan VINES, and Alloy
	  NTNX
	station number only unique for those PCs connected to same semaphore
	  service
	this function is called with AX=DC00h on entry by the DR DOS (up to
	  including 7.03) command processor to retrieve the connection number.
	  Old releases used this call only when INT 21/AX=EF03h failed.
	  Current versions (probably since one of the Novell DOS 7 updates)
	  attempt to retrieve the connection number from VLM (INT 2F/AX=7A20h
	  via GENERAL: 0043h/0006h/0001h and CONN: 0010h/0007h/000Dh) first.
	  The connection number is only trusted, however, when CF is clear on
	  return.
