INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "LSEEK" - SET CURRENT FILE POSITION
	AH = 42h
	AL = origin of move
	    00h start of file
	    01h current file position
	    02h end of file
	BX = file handle
	CX:DX = (signed) offset from origin of new file position
Return: CF clear if successful
	    DX:AX = new file position in bytes from start of file
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,06h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	for origins 01h and 02h, the pointer may be positioned before the
	  start of the file; no error is returned in that case (except under
	  Windows NT), but subsequent attempts at I/O will produce errors
	if the new position is beyond the current end of file, the file will
	  be extended by the next write (see AH=40h); for FAT32 drives, the
	  file must have been opened with AX=6C00h with the "extended size"
	  flag in order to expand the file beyond 2GB
BUG:	using this method to grow a file from zero bytes to a very large size
	  can corrupt the FAT in some versions of DOS; the file should first
	  be grown from zero to one byte and then to the desired large size
