INT 21 U - Memory Managers - GET API ENTRY POINT
	AX = 4402h subfn 00h
	BX = file handle for device "EMMXXXX0"
	CX = 0006h (size of buffer in bytes)
	DS:DX -> buffer for API entry point record (see #01512)
		first byte must be 00h on entry
Return: CF clear if successful
	    buffer filled (see #03603 at INT 67/AH=3Fh)
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,05h,06h,0Dh) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	this function is supported by Microsoft EMM386.EXE v4.45+ and
	  CEMM v5.10+, and is intended for use by MS Windows as it starts up
	if no other program has hooked INT 67, an alternate installation
	  check for CEMM is testing for the string
	  "COMPAQ EXPANDED MEMORY MANAGER 386" at offset 14h in the INT 67
	  handler's segment; if present, the word at offset 12h contains the
	  offset of the API entry point
SeeAlso: AX=4402h/SF=01h,AX=4402h/SF=02h,AX=4402h"EMM386",INT 67/AH=3Fh

Format of memory manager API entry point record:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 01512)
 00h	WORD	??? (0022h for CEMM 5.11, 0025h for MS EMM386 v4.45)
 02h	DWORD	manager's private API entry point
		(see #01513,#03666 at INT 67/AX=FFA5h)

(Table 01513)
Call CEMM v5.10+ entry point with:
	AH = 00h get memory manager's state
	    Return: AH = state
			bit 0: turned OFF
			bit 1: AUTO mode enabled
	AH = 01h set memory manager's state
	    AL = new state (00h ON, 01h OFF, 02h AUTO)
	    Return: CF clear if successful
		    CF set on error
	AH = 02h Weitek coprocessor support
	    AL = subfunction
		00h get Weitek support state
		    Return: AL = status
				bit 0: Weitek coprocessor is present
				bit 1: Weitek support is enabled
		01h turn on Weitek support
		02h turn off Weitek support
	    Return: CF clear if successful
		    CF set on error
			AH = error code (01h invalid subfunc, 02h no Weitek)
	AH = 05h get statistics
	    ???
	AH > 06h
	    Return: CF set
		    AH = 01h (invalid function)
Notes:	AH=03h,04h,06h are NOPs which return CF clear, presumably for backwards
	  compatibility with earlier versions of CEMM
	in v5.11, AH=05h merely prints an error message (using INT 21/AH=09h)
	  stating that a different version of CEMM is installed and it is
	  therefore not possible to display the statistics
