INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "RENAME" - RENAME FILE
	AH = 56h
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ filename of existing file (no wildcards, but see below)
	ES:DI -> ASCIZ new filename (no wildcards)
	CL = attribute mask (server call only, see below)
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (02h,03h,05h,11h) (see #01680)
Notes:	allows move between directories on same logical volume
	this function does not set the archive attribute
	  (see #01420 at AX=4301h), which results in incremental backups not
	  backing up the file under its new name
	open files should not be renamed
	(DOS 2.x only) this function renames file by creating a new directory
	  entry with the new name, then marking the old entry deleted
	(DOS 3.0+) allows renaming of directories
	(DOS 3.1+) wildcards are allowed if invoked via AX=5D00h, in which case
	  error 12h (no more files) is returned on success, and both source and
	  destination specs must be canonical (as returned by AH=60h).
	  Wildcards in the destination are replaced by the corresponding char
	  of each source file being renamed.  Under DOS 3.x, the call will fail
	  if the destination wildcard is *.* or equivalent; under DR DOS 5.0,
	  the call will fail with error code 03h if any wildcards are used.
	  When invoked via AX=5D00h, only those files matching the attribute
	  mask in CL are renamed.
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the old-name pointer is in DS:EDX
	  and the new-name pointer is in ES:EDI (DS must equal ES)
BUG:	(DR DOS 3.41) when invoked via AX=5D00h, this function will generate
	  a new directory entry with the new name (including any wildcards)
	  which can only be removed with a sector editor
