INT 21 - DOS 2+ - "FINDFIRST" - FIND FIRST MATCHING FILE
	AH = 4Eh
	AL = special flag for use by APPEND (refer to note below)
	CX = file attribute mask (see #01420 at AX=4301h) (bits 0 and 5 ignored)
	    0088h (Novell DOS 7) find first deleted file
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ file specification (may include path and wildcards)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    Disk Transfer Area filled with FindFirst data block (see #01626)
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (02h,03h,12h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	for search attributes other than 08h, all files with at MOST the
	  specified combination of hidden, system, and directory attributes
	  will be returned.  Under DOS 2.x, searching for attribute 08h
	  (volume label) will also return normal files, while under DOS 3.0+
	  only the volume label (if any) will be returned.
	this call also returns successfully if given the name of a character
	  device without wildcards.  DOS 2.x returns attribute 00h, size 0,
	  and the current date and time.  DOS 3.0+ returns attribute 40h and
	  the current date and time.
	immediately after an INT 2F/AX=B711h (APPEND return found name), the
	  name at DS:DX will be overwritten; if AL=00h on entry, the actual
	  found pathname will be stored, otherwise, the actual found path
	  will be prepended to the original filespec without a path.
	under LANtastic, this call may be used to obtain a list of a server's
	  shared resources by searching for "\\SERVER\*.*"; a list of printer
	  resources may be obtained by searching for "\\SERVER\@*.*"
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the filespec pointer is in DS:EDX
BUGS:	under DOS 3.x and 4.x, the second and subsequent calls to this function
	  with a character device name (no wildcards) and search attributes
	  which include the volume-label bit (08h) will fail unless there is
	  an intervening DOS call which implicitly or explicity performs a
	  directory search without the volume-label bit.  Such implicit
	  searches are performed by CREATE (AH=3Ch), OPEN (AH=3Dh), UNLINK
	  (AH=41h), and RENAME (AH=56h)
	DR DOS 3.41 and 5.0 return the Directory attribute for the volume label
