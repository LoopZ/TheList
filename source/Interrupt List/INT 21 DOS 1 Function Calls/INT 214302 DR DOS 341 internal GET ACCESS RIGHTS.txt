INT 21 - DR DOS 3.41+ internal - GET ACCESS RIGHTS
	AX = 4302h
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ pathname
Return: CF clear if successful
	    CX = access rights (see #01421)
	    AX = CX (DR DOS 5.0)
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code
Desc:	Determine which operations the calling program may perform on a
	  specified file without being required to provide a password.
Notes:	this protection scheme has been coordinated on all current Digital
	  Research/Novell operating systems (DR DOS 3.41+, DRMDOS 5.x, and
	  FlexOS 2+)
	this function is documented in DR DOS 6.0 and corresponds to the
	  "Get/Set File Attributes" function, subfunction 2, documented in
	  Concurrent DOS.
	only FlexOS actually uses the "execution" bits; DR DOS 3.41+ treats
	  them as "read" bits.
	DR DOS 3.41-5.x only use bits 0-3.  Only DR DOS 6.0 using a
	  DRMDOS 5.x security system allowing for users and groups uses bits
	  4-11.
