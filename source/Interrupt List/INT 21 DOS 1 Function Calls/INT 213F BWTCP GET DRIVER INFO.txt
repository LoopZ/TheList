INT 21 - BW-TCP - GET DRIVER INFO
	AH = 3Fh
	BX = file handle for device "ETHDEV27"
	CX = 002Bh
	DS:DX -> buffer for driver info (see #01412)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = number of bytes actually read (0 if at EOF before call)
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (05h,06h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Program: BW-TCP is a TCP/IP protocol stack by Beame & Whiteside Software
InstallCheck:	for the TCP/IP stack, test for the existence of the character
	  device UDP-IP10
Note:	the B&W socket library performs an INT 21/AX=4401h with DX=0060h before
	  making this call to retrieve the driver information; one should also
	  call the private API interrupt with AH=15h
