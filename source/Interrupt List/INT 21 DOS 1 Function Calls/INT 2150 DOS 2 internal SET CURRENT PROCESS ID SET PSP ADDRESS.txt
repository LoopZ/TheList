INT 21 - DOS 2+ internal - SET CURRENT PROCESS ID (SET PSP ADDRESS)
	AH = 50h
	BX = segment of PSP for new process
Notes:	DOS uses the current PSP address to determine which processes own files
	  and memory; it corresponds to process identifiers used by other OSs
	under DOS 2.x, this function cannot be invoked inside an INT 28h
	  handler without setting the Critical Error flag
	under MS-DOS 3.0+ and DR DOS 3.41+, this function does not use any of
	  the DOS-internal stacks and may thus be called at any time, even
	  during another INT 21h call
	some Microsoft applications such as Quick C 2.51 use segments of 0000h
	  and FFFFh and direct access to the SDA (see #01687 at AX=5D06h) to
	  test whether they are running under MS-DOS rather than a compatible
	  OS; although one should only call this function with valid PSP
	  addresses, any program hooking it should be prepared to handle
	  invalid addresses
	this function is supported by the OS/2 compatibility box
	this call was undocumented prior to the release of DOS 5.0
