INT 21 - LAN Manager Enhanced DOS - LOCAL NetWkstaGetInfo
	AX = 5F44h
	BX = information level (00h, 01h, or 0Ah)
	CX = buffer size
	DX = 0000h
	ES:DI -> buffer in which to store info (see #01714,#01715,#01716),
	      including any returned strings
Return: AX = error code
	DX = amount of buffer required, unchanged if supplied buffer large
	      enough to hold data
