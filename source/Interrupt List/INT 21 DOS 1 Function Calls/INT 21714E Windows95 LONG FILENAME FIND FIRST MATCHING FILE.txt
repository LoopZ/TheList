INT 21 - Windows95 - LONG FILENAME - FIND FIRST MATCHING FILE
	AX = 714Eh
	CL = allowable-attributes mask (see #01420 at AX=4301h)
	      (bits 0 and 5 ignored)
	CH = required-attributes mask (see #01420)
	SI = date/time format (see #01778)
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ filespec (both "*" and "*.*" match any filename)
	ES:DI -> FindData record (see #01779)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = filefind handle (needed to continue search)
	    CX = Unicode conversion flags (see #01780)
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code
		7100h if function not supported
Notes:	this function is only available when IFSMgr is running, not under bare
	  MS-DOS 7
	the application should close the filefind handle with AX=71A1h as soon
	  as it has completed its search
	for compatibility with DOS versions prior to v7.00, the carry flag
	  should be set on call to ensure that it is set on exit
SeeAlso: AH=4Eh,AX=714Fh,AX=71A1h

(Table 01778)
Values for Windows95 date/time format:
 0000h	use 64-bit file time format
 0001h	use MS-DOS date/time values (see #01665,#01666) in low double-word of
	  file time QWORD (date is high word, time is low word of double-word)
SeeAlso: #01779

Format of Windows95 long filename FindData record:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 01779)
 00h	DWORD	file attributes
		bits 0-6 standard DOS attributes (see #01420 at INT 21/AX=4301h)
		bit 8: temporary file
 04h	QWORD	file creation time (number of 100ns intervals since 1/1/1601)
 0Ch	QWORD	last access time
 14h	QWORD	last modification time
 1Ch	DWORD	file size (high 32 bits)
 20h	DWORD	file size (low 32 bits)
 24h  8 BYTEs	reserved (apparently unused)
 2Ch 260 BYTEs	ASCIZ full filename
130h 14 BYTEs	ASCIZ short filename (for backward compatibility)
Note:	under Windows95B, the ASCIZ short filename will be the empty string
	  if the directory does not contain a long filename entry for the
	  file; in that case, the application should use the full filename
SeeAlso: #01780

Bitfields for Windows95 Unicode conversion flags:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table 01780)
 0	the returned full filename contains underscores for un-convertable
	  Unicode characters
 1	the returned short filename contains underscores for un-convertable
	  Unicode characters
