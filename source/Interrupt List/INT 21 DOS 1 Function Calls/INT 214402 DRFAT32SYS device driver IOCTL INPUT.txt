INT 21 - DRFAT32.SYS device driver - IOCTL INPUT
	AX = 4402h
	BX = file handle referencing character device for DRFAT32.SYS driver
	    (e.g. "FAT32XXX" in the default configuration)
	CX = number of bytes to read
	DS:DX -> control block (see #04108)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = number of bytes actually read
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,05h,06h,0Dh) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Notes:	 the data returned depends on the first byte of the control block
	   the remainder of the control block is filled by the driver
	 one DRFAT32.SYS device driver supports up to 8 subunits (that is up
	   to 8 FAT32 partitions). By default, DRFAT32.SYS logs in all FAT32
	   partitions it finds, however, by using command line options /C (CHS),
	   /L (LBA), /H (Hidden) and /P:1..4 (Primary), /E:1..255 (Logical
	   Drive), and /U:min[,max] (Unit 128..255) it can be directed to
	   attach only to one or a specific range of partitions. Multiple
	   DRFAT32.SYS drivers can be loaded in a system when using the
	   /D:name option. To assign them to the redirector, the /D:name option
	   must be repeated for each of the DRFAT32.SYS drivers in the
	   DRFAT32.EXE command line.

Format of DRFAT32 control block:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 04108)
 00h	BYTE	data being requested
		00h device driver header address
		09h media change status
		48h address of DRFAT32 geometry table
		else error
---function 00h---
 01h	DWORD	device driver header address (see also AH=52h,#01646)
---function 09h---
 01h	BYTE	media change status
		00h don't know
		01h media unchanged
		FFh media has been changed
---DRFAT32 function 48h---
 01h	DWORD	address of DRFAT32 geometry table (see #04109)

Format of DRFAT32 Geometry Table:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 04109)
 00h 8*59 BYTEs	eight DRFAT32 partition data tables (see #04110)
 1D8h	BYTE	DRFAT32 access flags (see #04111)
 1D9h	BYTE	DRFAT32 status flags (see #04112)
Note:	This is the table layout used by DRFAT32.SYS 1.00 which supports up
	  to 8 sub-units. The layout of this table and its records may change,
	  so the version indicator in the device driver's signature ("FAT320")
	  and the size of the public data structure should be checked first.
