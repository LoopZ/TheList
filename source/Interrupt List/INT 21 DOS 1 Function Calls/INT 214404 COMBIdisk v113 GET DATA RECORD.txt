INT 21 - COMBI-disk v1.13 - GET DATA RECORD
	AX = 4404h
	BL = drive number (00h = default, 01h = A:, etc)
	CX = 0032h (length of data packet)
	DS:DX -> buffer for data packet (see #01535)
Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = number of bytes actually transferred
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,05h,06h,0Dh) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
Program: COMBI-disk is a shareware combination cache and RAMdisk sharing a
	  single pool of memory by Vadim V. Vlasov
InstallCheck:	scan the valid drives for one which returns a correctly-sized
	  data packet with the proper signature in the first field
