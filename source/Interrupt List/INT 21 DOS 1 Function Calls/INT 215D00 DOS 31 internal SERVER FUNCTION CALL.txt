 Unique ID: 215D00
  Category: D 	DOS kernel
      Flag: U 	undocumented function

INT 21 U - DOS 3.1+ internal - SERVER FUNCTION CALL
	AX = 5D00h
	DS:DX -> DOS parameter list (see #01686)
	DPL contains all register values for a call to INT 21h
Return: as appropriate for function being called
Notes:	does not check AH.  Out of range values will crash the system
	executes using specified computer ID and process ID
	sharing delay loops skipped
	a special sharing mode is enabled to handle FCBs opened across network
	wildcards are enabled for DELETE (AH=41h) and RENAME (AH=56h) under
	  MS-DOS; under DR DOS 3.41, wildcards corrupt the filesystem; and
	  under DR DOS 5.0-6.0, the call returns error code 03h due to improper
	  support for the server function call (refer to BUGS: section below)
	an extra file attribute parameter is enabled for OPEN (AH=3Dh),
	  DELETE (AH=41h), and RENAME (AH=56h)
	functions which take filenames require canonical names (as returned
	  by AH=60h); this is apparently to prevent multi-hop file forwarding
BUGS:	the OS/2 2.0 DOS Boot Session incorrectly maps DOS drive letters,
	  seemingly ignoring HPFS drives
	DR DOS 5.0-6.0 merely recursively call INT 21 after loading the
	  registers from the DPL, leading to problems for peer-to-peer
	  networks

Format of DOS parameter list:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 01686)
 00h	WORD	AX
 02h	WORD	BX
 04h	WORD	CX
 06h	WORD	DX
 08h	WORD	SI
 0Ah	WORD	DI
 0Ch	WORD	DS
 0Eh	WORD	ES
 10h	WORD	reserved (0)
 12h	WORD	computer ID (0 = current system)
 14h	WORD	process ID (PSP segment on specified computer)
Note:	under Windows Enhanced mode, the computer ID is normally the virtual
	  machine ID (see INT 2F/AX=1683h), though this can reportedly be
	  changed by setting UniqueDOSPSP= in SYSTEM.INI
