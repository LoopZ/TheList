INT 7A - Novell NetWare - IPXODI v2.12+ - OPEN LOOK-AHEAD SOCKET
	BX = 0023h
	DX = socket number (0000h for dynamic allocation)
	ES:SI -> Look Ahead handler (see #03831)
	BP = desired lookahead size (0000h-0080h)
Return: AL = status
	    00h successful
		DX = assigned socket number (big-endian)
	    FEh maximum number of sockets already open
	    FFh specific socket already opened by another application
	DS,FLAGS preserved
	all other registers may be destroyed
Notes:	the socket will always be long-lived, and must thus be explicitly
	  closed with INT 7A/BX=0001h before the Look Ahead handler code is
	  removed from memory (i.e. the program terminates)
	this function is only supported if INT 2F/AX=7A00h returns ES:BX
	  pointing at an IPX version greater than 3.30
	the desired lookahead size is the smallest-size packet (including IPX
	  header) that should be passed to the lookahead handler when it
	  arrives

(Table 03831)
Call IPX Look-Ahead handler with:
	AX = packet's destination socket
	DS:SI -> look-ahead structure (see #03010 at INT 2F/AX=C000h"LSL")
	DF clear
	interrupt disabled (must remain disabled)
Return: AX = packet use
	    0000h application want packet
		ES:SI -> ODI ECB (see #03011 at INT 2F/AX=C000h"LSL")
	    8001h application does not want packet
	ZF set if AX=0000h
	DS,DI,BP,SS,SP preserved
	interrupts disabled
