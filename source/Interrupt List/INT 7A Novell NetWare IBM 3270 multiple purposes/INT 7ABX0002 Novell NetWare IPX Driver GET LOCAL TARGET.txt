INT 7A - Novell NetWare - IPX Driver - GET LOCAL TARGET
	BX = 0002h
	ES:SI -> target internetwork address (see #03824 at INT 7A/BX=000Bh)
	ES:DI -> 6-byte buffer for local target
Return: AL = return code
	    00h success
	       CX = expected one-way transfer time (clock ticks) for a 576-byte
		      packet
	       ES:DI -> local target
	    FAh unsuccessful (no path to destination)
Notes:	the internetwork address consists of a 4-byte network address followed
	  by a 6-byte node address.  The local target is only a 6-byte node
	  address.  If the target is in the same network, the local target is
	  just the node address of target; otherwise, the local target is the
	  node address of the bridge that leads to the target.
	this function may be called from inside IPX and AES Event Service
	  Routines, but not from other interrupt handlers
	this function is supported by Advanced NetWare 1.02+
