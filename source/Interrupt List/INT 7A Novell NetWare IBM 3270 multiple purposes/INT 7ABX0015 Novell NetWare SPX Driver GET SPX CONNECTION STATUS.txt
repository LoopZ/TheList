INT 7A - Novell NetWare - SPX Driver - GET SPX CONNECTION STATUS
	BX = 0015h
	DX = connection ID
	ES:SI -> status buffer (see #03828)
Return: AL = return code (00h,EEh) (see also #03825)
	    00h connection still valid
		ES:SI -> status buffer filled
Note:	this function is supported by Advanced NetWare 2.1+
SeeAlso: BX=0010h,BX=0011h

		02h starting (attempting to create connection)
		03h connection established
		04h terminating
 01h	BYTE	watchdog flag
		bit 0: used internally by SPX
		bit 1: SPX watchdog is monitoring connection

		  without ACK from local SPX
 0Ch	WORD	(big-endian) remote acknowledge number, next sequence number
		  remote SPX expects to receive
 0Eh	WORD	(big-endian) remote allocation number, maximum sequence number
		  local SPX may send
