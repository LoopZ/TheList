INT 7A - Novell NetWare - SPX Driver - ESTABLISH SPX CONNECTION
	BX = 0011h
	AL = retry count
	AH = watchdog flag
	ES:SI -> Event Control Block (see #03810 at BX=0003h)
Return: AL = status (00h,EFh,FDh,FFh) (see #03825)
	DX = assigned connection ID number
Desc:	attempt to establish a connection with a listening socket
Notes:	there should always be at least two SPX ECB's listening to a socket, so
	  that NetWare can perform its internal packet exchanges
	the first fragment should start with a SPX header (see #03826).	Fill
	  in all destination addresses.
	this function is supported by Advanced NetWare 2.1+
