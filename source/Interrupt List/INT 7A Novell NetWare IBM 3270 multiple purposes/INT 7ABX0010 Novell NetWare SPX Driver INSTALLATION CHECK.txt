Notes:	this function is supported by Advanced NetWare 2.1+
	this interrupt is used for IPX/SPX access in NetWare versions through
	  2.0a; in later versions, you should use INT 2F/AX=7A00h to get an
	  entry point even though INT 7A still exists.	For both INT 7A and
	  the FAR entry point, BX contains the function number
	IPX is sometimes called internally with BX bit 15 set, which causes the
	  entry point handler to bypass some checks and an optional call to
	  the IPX Windows support handler set with INT 2F/AX=7AFFh/BX=0000h
	  (see #02926)
