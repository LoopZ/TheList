INT 7A - DJGPP GO32.EXE DOS EXTENDER - RELOCATED IRQ2
Program: GO32.EXE is a DOS extender included as part of the 80386 port of the
	  GNU C/C++ compiler by DJ Delorie and distributed as DJGPP
Notes:	this vector is overwritten when GO32 starts but is not restored by
	  early versions of the extender
	the newest versions of GO32 dynamically allocate the vectors used
	  for the relocated IRQs, much as DESQview does (see INT 50"DESQview")
SeeAlso: INT 0A"IRQ2",INT 79"GO32",INT 7B"GO32"
