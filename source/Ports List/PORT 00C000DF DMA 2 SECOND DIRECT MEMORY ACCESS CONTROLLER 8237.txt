Notes:	the temporary register is used as holding register in memory-to-memory
	  DMA transfers; it holds the last transferred byte
	channel 4 is used for cascading the first (8-bit) DMA controller
	base/current address registers can only address the memory in 16-bit
	  words (i.e. they contain lines A1-A16 of the address bus with line
	  A0 always equal to 0); base/current word count registers contain the
	  number of 16-bit words
	command and request registers do not exist on PS/2 DMA controller
