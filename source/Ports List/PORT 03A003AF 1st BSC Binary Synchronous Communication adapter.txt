PORT 03A0-03AF - 1st BSC (Binary Synchronous Communication) adapter
Notes:	Initialization of the BSC adapter is performed in a typical
	  sequence like this: Setup 8255 port A-C configuration by writing
	  98h to 383h, followed by initializing 8255 port C by writing 0Dh
	  to 382h. Reset 8251A internal registers by pulsing 8255 port B4.
	  After this the 8253 has to be programmed to the desired values
	  (counter 0 not used, counters 1 and 2 to mode 0). Now, the 8251A
	  is ready to be loaded with a set of control words that define the
	  communication environment.
	8251A: The control words are split into two formats, mode
	  instruction and command instruction. The mode instruction must
	  be inserted immediately after a reset operation (via 8255 port B4
	  or setting command instruction bit6 to 'internal reset').
	  The required synchronization characters are next loaded into the
	  8251A (usually 32h for BSC). All control words written to the
	  8251A after this will load the command instruction.
