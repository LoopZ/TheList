PORT 0140-014F - Xirlink/Relialogic XL-220/221 SCSI adapter
Range:	alternate address at 0150, 0160, 0170
Notes:	XL-220/221 are based on LOGIC Devices L53C80JC4 SCSI controller which
	  is compatible with Symbios Logic (formaerly NCR) 53C80
	each SCSI data pin is inverted and compared with correcponding bit
	  in the ID select register; if any matches are found while a bus free
	  condition exists and SEL is active, SCSI controller will genarate an
	  interrupt to indicate a selection or reselection
	pseudo-DMA register is provided by some on-card PLM, and decodes any
	  address in the range 01x8-01xF; it should be accessed with 16-bit
	  I/O instructions only causing 2 SCSI REQ/ACK hanshakes (8-bit I/O
	  is treated as 16-bit, and second byte is lost); delayed assertion of
	  the REQ signal or bus free condition on the SCSI bus causes the
	  pseudo-DMA register to prolong ISA I/O cycle not asserting IOCHRDY
	  signal (SCSI phase mismatch doesn't), and so may cause ISA bus to
	  hang in not ready state!
	SCSI BIOS is an 8K ROM located at C8000-CBFFF if I/O port range
	  0140-014F is selected, at CC000-CFFFF if I/O port range 0150-015F
	  is selected, at D8000-DBFFF if I/O port range 0160-016F is selected,
	  and at DC000-DFFFF if I/O port range 0170-017F is selected
