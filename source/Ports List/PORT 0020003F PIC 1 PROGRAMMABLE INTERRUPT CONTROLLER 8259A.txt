Bitfields for PIC output control word OCW3:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table P0016)
 7	reserved (0)
 6-5	special mask
	0x  no operation
	10  reset special mask

Note:	the special mask mode permits all other interrupts (even those with
	  lower priority) to be processed while an interrupt is already in
	  service, but will not re-issue an interrupt for a particular IRQ
	  while it remains in service
