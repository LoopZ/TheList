0008  -W  DMA channel 0-3 command register (see #P0002)
0009  -W  DMA channel 0-3 write request register (see #P0003)
000A  RW  DMA channel 0-3 mask register (see #P0004)
000B  -W  DMA channel 0-3 mode register (see #P0005)

000C  -W  DMA channel 0-3 clear byte pointer flip-flop register
	  any write clears LSB/MSB flip-flop of address and counter registers
000D  R-  DMA channel 0-3 temporary register
000D  -W  DMA channel 0-3 master clear register
	  any write causes reset of 8237
000E  -W  DMA channel 0-3 clear mask register
	  any write clears masks for all channels
000F  rW  DMA channel 0-3 write mask register (see #P0006)
Notes:	the temporary register is used as holding register in memory-to-memory
	  DMA transfers; it holds the last transferred byte
	channel 2 is used by the floppy disk controller
	on the IBM PC/XT channel 0 was used for the memory refresh and
	  channel 3 was used by the hard disk controller
	on AT and later machines with two DMA controllers, channel 4 is used
	  as a cascade for channels 0-3
	command and request registers do not exist on a PS/2 DMA controller
