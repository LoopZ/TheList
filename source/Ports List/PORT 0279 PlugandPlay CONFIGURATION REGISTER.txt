PORT 0279 - Plug-and-Play - CONFIGURATION REGISTER
SeeAlso: PORT 0A79h

0279  -W  index into Plug-and-Play register set for Read Data Port and
	  Write Data Port I/O (see #P0550,#P0551)

(Table P0550)
Values for Plug-and-Play Card-Level Registers:
 00h	set Read Port address
	bits 9-2 of Read Data port address (bits 15-10 are always 0, bits 1-0
	  are always 11); valid Read Port addresses are 0203h-03FFh
 01h	serial isolation
 02h	configuration control
 03h	Wake command
	(specifies which card is accessed through configuration registers)
 04h	resource data
 05h	status
 06h	Card Select Number (CSN)
 07h	logical device number
	(selects which logical device on card is accessed at locations 30h-FFh)
	(see #P0551)
 08h-1Fh reserved
 20h-2Fh vendor-specific
Note:	there is one set of these registers per installed card

(Table P0551)
Values for Plug-and-Play Logical Device Registers:
 30h	activate
	bit 0: device is active on ISA bus
	bits 7-1: reserved (0)

	bit 0: I/O Read Pattern select (if bit 1 set, then I/O reads return
		55h if this bit is set, AAh if this bit is clear)
	bit 1: I/O Range Check Enable: if set, all reads from device I/O
		  registers return 55h or AAh, depending on bit 0
	bits 7-2: reserved (0)
