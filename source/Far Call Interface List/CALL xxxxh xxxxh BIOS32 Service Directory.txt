CALL xxxxh:xxxxh - BIOS32 Service Directory
InstallCheck:	scan paragraph boundaries E000h to FFFFh for signature string
	"_32_", followed by a valid header structure (see #F0021)
Notes:	a 32-bit-code alternate PCI BIOS entry point may be found (if
	  supported) by requesting the entry point for the API with
	  identifier "$PCI"
	an alternate entry point for INT 1A/AH=B4h may be found (if
	  supported) by requesting the entry point for the API with identifier
	  "$ACF"
	other known identifiers are "$WDS" and "MPTN"

Format of BIOS32 Service Directory header structure:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table F0021)
 00h  4 BYTEs	signature "_32_"
 04h	DWORD	physical address of BSD entry point (see #F0022)
 08h	BYTE	header structure version number (currently 00h)
 09h	BYTE	header structure length in paragraphs (currently 01h)
 0Ah	BYTE	checksum (8-bit sum of all bytes in structure, including this
		  one, should equal zero)
 0Bh  5 BYTEs	reserved (0)

(Table F0022)
Call BIOS32 Service Directory entry point with:
	EBX = function
	    00000000h get service entry point
		EAX = service identifier
		    46434124h ("FCA$") Plug-and-Play Auto-Configuration
		    49435024h ("ICP$") PCI BIOS
		    4E54504Dh ("NTPM") ??? MPTN [PhoenixBIOS4 Rev. 6.0]
		    54435724h ("SDW$") ??? WDS$ [PhoenixBIOS4 Rev. 6.0]
		Return: AL = status
			    00h successful
				 EBX = base address of handler's code seg
				 ECX = size of code segment
				 EDX = offset of handler in code seg
			    80h unknown service identifier
	    else
		Return: AL = 81h invalid function
Notes:	the BSD handler assumes that it is running in a 32-bit code segment
	the returned entry points for PCI BIOS and Auto-Config must be called
	  with the same registers as the real-mode INT 1Ah interface,
	  including the value B1h or B4h in AH (AMI BIOS v1.00.05.AX1 returns
	  the same entry point for both interfaces and uses AH to distinguish
	  which API is desired)
	some references indicate that only BL is used for the function number,
	  though at least one implementation actually checks the entire EBX
	  register; for maximum compatibility, the upper 24 bits of EBX should
	  be cleared when calling the entry point
