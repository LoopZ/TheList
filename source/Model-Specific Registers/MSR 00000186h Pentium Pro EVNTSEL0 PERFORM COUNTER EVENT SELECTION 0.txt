Bitfields for Pentium Pro Event Selection MSR:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table R0047)
 31-24	CMASK (counter mask)
	compare actual count for event on this clock cycle with mask; only
	  increment counter if count >= mask (count < mask if bit 23 set)
 23	invert result of CMASK condition
 22	enable counting of events
 21	reserved
 20	signal performance counter overflows via APIC input
 19	signal performance counter overflows via BP0/BP1 pin
 18	count occurrences, not duration
 17	OS (enable counting in ring 0)
 16	USER (enable counting in rings 1,2,3)
 15-8	UMASK (Unit Mask register; set to 0 to enable all count options)
 7-0	event type (see #R0048)
