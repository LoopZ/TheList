ACCESS.bus
	A further development of the I2C bus which forms the physical layer
of the Universal Serial Bus.  Because ACCESS.bus is used for communication with
external devices, it includes power and ground wires in addition to I2C's clock
and data lines, and permits twice the current draw (6ma) on the clock and data
lines.	see also I2C, SMBus.
