Redirector Interface
	The set of device-independent INT 2Fh function calls invoked by
the MSDOS kernel to operate on devices it recognizes as network
devices.  These function calls provide a lower-level interface than the
INT 21h calls made to DOS, allowing a program intercepting these
functions to be simpler than one intercepting INT 21h calls.  See INT
2Fh Functions 1100h through 1130h.
