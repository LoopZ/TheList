BCD

	(Binary Coded Decimal) A method of data storage where two
decimal digits are stored in each byte, one in the upper four bits and
the other in the lower four bits.  Since only the values 0 through 9
are used in each half of a byte, BCD values can be read as decimal
numbers on a hexadecimal display of memory or a file.
