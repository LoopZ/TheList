Vertical Retrace
	When a monitor has finished displaying an image by sweeping its
electron beam(s) over the face of the CRT, it has to move the beam back up
to the top of the display.  During the time this takes, the beam is turned
off.  The vertical retrace interval is a good time to change the displayed
picture for smooth animation.  See also Horizontal Retrace.
