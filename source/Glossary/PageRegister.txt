Page Register
	A peripheral register or I/O port used to extend the addressing
range of some other register or I/O port.  The prime example are
the DMA page registers, which allow the DMA controller to address
more than 64K (since the DMA controller only contains 16 address
lines; this is the cause of the 64K DMA boundaries).
