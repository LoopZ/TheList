I2C
	(also IIC; the "2" is superscripted) Inter-Integrated Circuit
Bus -- A moderate-speed serial communications bus originally invented
by Philips in the early 1980s for consumer-electronics applications,
such as inter-chip communication in a television set or high-end
stereo.	 The I2C bus has recently appeared on PCs in video capture
boards and similar devices, as well as (surprisingly) SDRAM DIMMs (for
the on-board serial EEPROM).  The ACCESS.bus is a derivative of the I2C
bus which forms the physical layer of the Universal Serial Bus.	 Similary,
the SMBus (System Management Bus) also uses I2C as its physical layer.
