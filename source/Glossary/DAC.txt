DAC
	(Digital-to-Analog Converter) A hardware device (in its simplest
form, nothing more than a set of interconnected resistors) which converts
a digital number into an analog signal whose voltage is proportional to
the value of the digital number.  VGA and later color video boards use
DACs to convert color values into the analog signals sent to the display;
sound boards normally use DACs as well.
