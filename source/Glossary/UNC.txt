UNC
	(Universal Naming Convention) The standard way of describing
network servers and their directories under MS-DOS and Windows NT.  A
name in UNC format consists of two backslashes followed by the server
name, optionally followed by another backslash and a list of
backslash-separated fields; for example
\\SERVER1\SHARED-DIR\SUBDIR1\SUBDIR2\FILENAME.EXT.
