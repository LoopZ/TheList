Cache
	Caching is a method of increasing performance by keeping
frequently-used data in a location which is more quickly accessed. The
most common caches are disk caches (store disk sectors in RAM) and RAM
caches (store portions of main memory in special high-speed RAM which
may be accessed as fast as the CPU is capable of accessing memory).
