MSR
	(Model-Specific Register) Additional, indirectly-accessible,
registers containing control or status information about various
aspects of the processor such as caches, performance counters, and the
like.	These registers, accessible via the RDMSR and WRMSR
instructions, were added with the Pentium and later-model 486
processors.
