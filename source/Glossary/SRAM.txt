SRAM

	(Static Random Access Memory)  RAM which typically consists of one
flip-flop per bit of memory.  Unlike DRAMs, static RAM retains its contents
as long as power is applied.  Because there is no need to refresh the
contents of memory addresses which are read, SRAM is faster than DRAM,
but it is more expensive and typically is available in much smaller sizes
than DRAM because each bit occupies more space on the chip.  See also DRAM.
