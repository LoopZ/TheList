Disk Transfer Address
	The Disk Transfer Address indicates where functions which do
not take an explicit data address will read or store data.  Although
the name implies that only disk accesses use this address, other
functions use it as well.  See INT 21h Function 4Eh for an example of
the DTA's use.
