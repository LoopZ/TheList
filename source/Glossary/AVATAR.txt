AVATAR
	(Advanced Video Attribute Terminal Assembler and Recreator) A
set of control codes which may be used to affect the output of
characters to the screen on systems equipped with an appropriate
driver.	 Similar in intent to ANSI sequences, AVATAR has shorter
command sequences and provides additional PC-specific functionality.
AVATAR is primarily used by the Opus and Maximus bulletin board systems
(it was designed by one of the developers of the Opus system).
