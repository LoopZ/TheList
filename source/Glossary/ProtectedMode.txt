Protected Mode
	One of the operating modes of the 80286 and higher Intel
processors, in which addresses used by programs no longer correspond to
physical addresses and the CPU enforces various protection mechanisms
designed to prevent one program from disrupting other programs or the
operating system.  See also Real Mode, Virtual-86 Mode.
