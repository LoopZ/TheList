BASIC
	(Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) A
programming language originally designed as a means of teaching
FORTRAN.  There are many variations of BASIC with differing
capabilities; the majority are interpreted but compiled BASIC is
becoming more popular.	All genuine IBM personal computers (including
the latest PS/2 models) come equipped with a cassette-based BASIC
interpreter in ROM.
