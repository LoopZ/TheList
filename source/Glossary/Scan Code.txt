Scan Code

	The actual key number sent by the keyboard, which differs from the
key codes seen by application programs.	 The enhanced (101/102-key) keyboard
actually sends different scan codes than the original (83/84-key) IBM
keyboard, but these are normally translated by the keyboard controller into
the scan codes used by the original keyboard before they become visible to
programs.
