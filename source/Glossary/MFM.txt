MFM
	(Modified Frequency Modulation) A method of encoding data as a
series of magnetic flux reversals on disk or tape, commonly known as
double-density recording.  In contrast to FM, modified frequency
modulation omits all clock pulses except those between pairs of zero
bits.  See also FM, RLL.
