Real Mode

	One of the operating modes of the 80286 and higher Intel
processors, and the only operating mode of the 8088, 8086, 80186, and
80188 processors.  In this mode, all addresses used by programs
correspond directly to real physical addresses (thus the full name,
Real Address Mode) and there are no CPU-imposed protections between
programs.  See also Protected Mode, Virtual-86 Mode.
