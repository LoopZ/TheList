Exception
	A signal by the CPU that some error condition has been encountered
that it can not deal with without a program's intervention.  The most commonly
encountered exceptions on Intel processors are Exceptions 12 and 13 (decimal,
how Intel specifies exception numbers), which are stack and general problems,
respectively.  Exception 13 is typically caused by a memory access which wraps
from the end of a segment back to the beginning.
