API
	(Application Program[ming] Interface) The defined set of calls
which a program may make to interact with or request services of the
operating system or environment under which it is running.  Because the
inputs and outputs of the calls are well-defined, a program using the
API can continue using the identical calls even if the internal
organization of the program providing the API changes.
