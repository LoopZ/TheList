SMBus
	(System Management Bus) A derivative of the I2C bus used for
communication between various components of a computer, such as smart
batteries and their chargers.  In contrast to I2C, SMBus specifies
fixed voltage levels (instead of relative to the power supply voltage)
and a 10 KHz minimum clock rate (I2C minimum is 0).  SMBus also
specifies several timings which are not required by I2C.  See also I2C,
ACCESS.bus.
