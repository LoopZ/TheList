undocumented
	Information about a product which is not publicly available from
the manufacturer, and must be determined by reverse-engineering (disassembly,
trial-and-error, etc.).	 Undocumented information tends to change -- often
dramatically -- between successive revisions of a product, since the
manufacturer has no obligation to maintain compatibility in behavior which
is not explicitly stated.
