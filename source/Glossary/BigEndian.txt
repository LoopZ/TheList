Big-Endian
	One of the two major ways of organizing multi-byte numeric
values in memory.  A big-endian layout places the most significant byte
of the value in the lowest (first) memory location, i.e. 12345678h is
stored as 12h 34h 56h 78h.  Motorola processors are big-endian.	 Compare
Little-Endian.
