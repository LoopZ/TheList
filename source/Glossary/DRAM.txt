DRAM
	(Dynamic Random Access Memory) RAM memory which essentially consists
of a tiny capacitor for each bit of memory.  Since capacitors do not hold
a charge indefinitely, DRAM must be constantly refreshed to avoid losing
its contents.  Also, the process of reading the contents of the memory are
destructive, meaning extra time must be spent restoring the contents of
memory addresses which are accessed, so DRAM is slower than SRAM.  See also
Refresh, SRAM.
