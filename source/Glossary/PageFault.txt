Page Fault
	A CPU-generated signal, and the operating system's reaction to it,
generated when a program accesses a page of virtual memory which is not
located in RAM at the time.  The operating system's response is to load in
the required page, possibly writing some other page out to disk in order
to make room.  See also INT 0E in INTERRUP.LST.
