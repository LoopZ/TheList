ESDI
	(Enhanced Small Device Interface) A disk drive interface type
which was briefly popular before IDE took over.	 An ESDI drive can
transfer data between the drive and controller at 10, 15, or 20
megabits per second, which is faster than an MFM or RLL controller but
slower than what is possible with an IDE or SCSI drive.	 See also IDE.
