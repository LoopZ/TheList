Virtual-86 Mode

	One of the operating modes of the 80386 and 80486 processors in
which user programs run as if the CPU were in Real Mode, while
providing the protection and address-mapping capabilities of Protected
Mode to a supervisor program which oversees the virtual machine on
which the user programs are running.  This mode is called Virtual-86
because one or more virtual 8086 environments are run on a single CPU.
See also Protected Mode, Real Mode, Virtual Machine.
