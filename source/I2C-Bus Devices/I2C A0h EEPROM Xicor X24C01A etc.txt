I2C A0h - EEPROM (Xicor X24C01A, etc.)
Access:	Read/Write
Range:	I2C addresses A0h,A2h,A4h,...,AEh, depending on external pin inputs
Notes:	the I2C specification defines bus addresses Axh for use by memory
	  devices (EEPROMs, etc.)
	in general, any byte of an EEPROM may be written by sending a three-
	  byte I2C telegram consisting of the bus address, the byte address
	  within the device, and the new value for that memory location
	for the X24C01A and other devices, an entire page may be written with
	  a single telegram by writing the bus address, start address of the
	  page, and one page's worth of data bytes
	in general, EEPROMs maintain a current-location pointer, so that
	  any reads start at that location within the device and increment
	  the pointer for each byte read; random reads are possible by writing
	  the desired new address to the EEPROM (i.e. perform a write as though
	  setting a memory location, but either terminate the telegram or send
	  a repeated start condition after the address byte)
	after a write, the X24C01A and most other EEPROMs will no longer ACK
	  telegrams directed at the device until the internal write cycle is
	  completed, which may take several milliseconds
