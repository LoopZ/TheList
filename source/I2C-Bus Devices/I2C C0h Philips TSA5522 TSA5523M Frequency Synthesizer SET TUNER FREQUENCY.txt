I2C C0h - Philips TSA5522/TSA5523M Frequency Synthesizer - SET TUNER FREQUENCY
Access:	Write
Size:	4 BYTEs
Range:	I2C addresses C0h, C2h, C4h, or C6h, selectable by external pin
Desc:	the tuner is programmed by writing four bytes: high byte of Freq
	  (bit 7 must be 0), low byte of Freq, high byte of band (bit 7 must
	  be 1), and low byte of band.
Notes:	Freq is the 16 * (desired frequency in MHz + IF frequency), assuming
	  a reference divisor of 512; multiply by 20 or 32 for divisors 640
	  and 1024.  (IF = 47 [2Fh] typically)
	the FI1236MK2 is software-compatible with the TSA5523M
	the TSA5055T is also software-compatible, with the exception that the
	  step size is fixed at 125 kHz (for a 4MHz external crystal) in order
	  to provide a top frequency of 2.5 GHz
	the TSA5512 and TSA5515T are also software-compatible, with a step size
	  fixed at 62.5 kHz (with a 4MHz external crystal); on the 5515T, only
	  output ports P1, P2, and P7 are available
	because the high bits of the first and third data bytes distinguish
	  between frequency and control bytes, either half may be programmed
	  independently; when switching bands and the new frequency is less
	  than the current frequency, Philips recommends sending the control
	  bytes first to avoid unnecessary charge pump action which can push
	  the tuner into extreme states

Bitfields for Philips TSA5523M Tuner band:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table I0118)
 7-0	open-collector control bits
	each bit turns on one NPN transistor
 2-0	(TSA5522) band-switch
	001 Band C (430-810 MHz)
	010 Band A (50-180 MHz)
	100 Band B (160-470 MHz)
 3	(TSA5522) don't care -- no external connection
 7,5,4	(TSA5523M) band-switch
	011 put 0.8V on Pin BS (Philips Mixer/Oscillator Band C)
	101 put 0.4V on Pin BS (Philips M/O Band B)
	110 put 0.25V on Pin BS (Philips M/O Band A)
	111 put Vcc on Pin BS (Philips Mixer/Oscillator Band C)
	other: same as 111
 8	tuning amplifier control
	=0 normal operation (on)
	=1 disable charge pump (off)
 10-9	reference divider ratio select
	x0 = 640 (yields 50 kHz step size)
	01 = 1024 (yields 31.25 kHz step size)
	11 = 512 (yields 62.5 kHz step size)
	(TSA5055T) these bits are officially supposed to be 11
	(TSA5512) these bits are officially supposed to be 11
 13-11	test bits
	001 normal operation
	01x charge pump off
	100 f_ref is available on P6 output (5523M) or LOCK output (5522)
	101 f_div2 is available on P6 output (5523M) or LOCK output (5522)
	110 charge pump is sinking current
	111 charge pump is sourcing current
 14	charge-pump current (0 = 50 microamperes, 1 = 250 uA)
	=1 gives faster tuning, =0 better residual FM
 15	must be set (indicates control byte for partial programming)
Note:	on the Stealth64 Video 2001TV, bits 7-3 appear to be ignored
