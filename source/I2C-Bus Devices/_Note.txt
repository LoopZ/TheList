Notes:	An I2C device uses two consecutive subaddresses; the low bit indicates
	  whether a read (bit 0 = 1) or write (bit 0 = 0) is being performed
	the header of each entry in this file indicates the device's subaddress
	  (the "slave address" in official terminology) and the register number
	  within the device; for certain indexed registers, the index value is
	  given as the third value in the entry header
	SMBus, ACCESS.bus, and the DDC2B data link to the monitor are all
	  variants of the I2C bus, and are thus listed here as well.
	unless otherwise noted, all device registers are eight bits in size,
	  and may be both read and written
	the access method for communicating with an I2C device is
	  implementation-dependent; for example, recent S3 chipsets supporting
	  the "Scenic Highway" Local Peripheral Bus access the I2C bus via
	  bit-banging of memory-mapped I/O register FF20h
	  (see MEM A000h:FF00h"S3").  On the Zoran ZR36057 used by the
	  Miro DC-30, the I2C bus is accessed by bit-banging memory-mapped
	  register 17 (at offset 0x44).	 On the Cirrus Logic GD7556, extended
	  sequencer register 8 is used (see #P0677).
	maximum data rates on the I2C bus are also device-dependent; typical
	  maximum rates are 80 kHz (DIMMs), 100 kHz (VPX3220A), and 400 kHz.
	in DDC (Dislay Data Channel) 2B, the monitor's EDID info appears to be
	  stored in an EEPROM at the standard bus address of A0h; access to
	  the DDC clock/data lines is, however, chipset-specific.  On S3's
	  Trio64V+, the DDC lines share a port with the LPB's I2C bus: when the
	  feature connector is disabled, they are connected to the monitor;
	  when enabled, the lines are connected to the Local Peripheral Bus
