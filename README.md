# The List

It has been several decades since the most recent update to *Ralf Brown's Interrupt List*.
While DOS itself has not changed much since that time, the _Interrupt List_ could use a
few corrections. Plus, there is a lot of additional information which could be included.

This project aims to continue the development of _The List_ beyond the final release of
the original _Interrupt List_ released in July of 2000. This is only an improvement to
the documentation. The original programs and utilities provided in the original version
of _Ralf Brown's Interrupt List_ are not provided. Those programs and the original list
can still be obtained through [Ralf's webpage at CMU](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ralf/).
