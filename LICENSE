Permission is granted to use and redistribute the files comprising the
interrupt listing in any way (including conversion to another format),
provided that my name and addresses and the names of all contributers
are preserved, as well as the information on how to obtain new releases.
The above requirement to give credit is waived for excerpts totaling
less than 2000 lines (although common courtesy indicates that you
should give some form of acknowledgment).

Some of the archives in the distribution contains programs contributed
by others; these programs are included as a service to users of the
interrupt list and the authors retain the rights to their programs.

Please send corrections/additions to the interrupt list me rather than
distributing a modified version of the list, so that all may benefit from
your contribution.  Corrections to programs contributed by others should
be sent directly to their authors.

Beitr„ge werden auch gerne in Deutsch angenommen!
